# MCP Tools and Contracts

This guide defines the MCP tool surface, behavior expectations, and key operational rules.

## Tool Handler Split

### Management tools
Implemented in:
- `src/mcp/management-tool-handler.ts`

These cover:
- `manage_projects`
- `manage_sprints`
- `manage_tasks`
- `manage_quicksprints`
- `manage_scheduler`
- `scheduler_code_ux`
- `manage_agents`
- `manage_node_flows`
- `manage_memory`
- `add_long_term_memory`
- `manage_skills`
- `search_knowledge`
- `search_skills`
- `manage_settings`
- `manage_preview`
- `manage_custom_dashboards`
- `manage_chat_providers`
- `manage_telemetry`
- `register_worker_endpoint`
- `pull_task_dispatch`
- `update_task_dispatch`

The same management domains are also exposed through the direct `codeux` CLI management surface. See [CLI Commands Reference](../reference/cli-commands.md) for the command syntax, aliases, interactive prompting behavior, and approval handling.

### Core tools
Implemented in:
- `src/mcp/core-tool-handler.ts`

These cover:
- `get_session`
- listen-mode connection registration and inbox/reply flow

### Agent tools
Implemented in:
- `src/mcp/agent-tool-handler.ts`

These cover:
- `generate_dashboard_reply`

### Management
- `manage_projects`
- `manage_sprints`
- `manage_tasks`
- `manage_quicksprints`
- `manage_scheduler`
- `scheduler_code_ux`
- `manage_agents`
- `manage_node_flows`
- `manage_memory`
- `add_long_term_memory`
- `manage_skills`
- `search_knowledge`
- `search_skills`
- `manage_settings`
- `manage_preview`
- `manage_custom_dashboards`
- `manage_chat_providers`
- `manage_telemetry`

### Worker control plane
- `register_worker_endpoint`
- `pull_task_dispatch`
- `update_task_dispatch`

These tools are exposed by the main `project_manager` MCP runtime, including server mode. `register_worker_endpoint` records the full eligible `projectIds` set and stores `activeProjectIds` only as the current focus subset. `pull_task_dispatch` returns a dispatch only with a lease token; workers must not start local execution without that token. `update_task_dispatch` renews running leases, records terminal state, and may return `controlAction: "cancel"` when the dashboard has requested cancellation.

## Registered Tools

Defined in `src/contracts/mcp-tool-definitions.ts`.

Typed tool argument contracts and registry dispatch are defined in `src/api/mcp/tool-registry.ts`.

- `get_session`
### Listen mode
- `listen`
- `start_listen`
- `pull_inbox`
- `post_listen_reply`

### Agent execution
- `generate_dashboard_reply`

### Output minimization
- `get_session` returns a compact session summary (state, provider, PR links, last activity summary) instead of full raw payload.

## Per-Agent Tool Access

Worker MCP clients can advertise their agent preset with the `X-Code-Ux-Agent` header on the Code UX MCP connection. When the header is absent, Code UX treats the request as a project-manager or stdio-style client and applies the system MCP tool toggles for the current runtime role.

When the header is present, Code UX must resolve it to an explicit agent MCP access policy before exposing built-in Code UX management tools. Malformed HTTP header values are rejected before MCP routing; if an advertised agent identity reaches the router but is unknown or resolves to an agent without an explicit MCP access policy, `list_tools` returns no Code UX tools and `call_tool` rejects every Code UX management tool with MCP `MethodNotFound`. This fail-closed behavior prevents an unrecognized agent from inheriting broad system-level management access.

For a resolved agent policy:
- `codeUxEnabled: false` removes the general built-in Code UX management surface. Narrow audience grants can still expose `request_clarification`, `reply_to_clarification`, or existing persistent-skill retrieval without enabling unrelated tools.
- `codeUxEnabled: true` applies the agent's per-tool overrides over the system MCP tool toggles.
- Runtime-role filtering still applies after system and agent policy checks.
- Custom external MCP servers remain limited to the agent's linked server ids and are not broadened by Code UX tool availability.

The dashboard chat reply route is the only route-local default exception. The agent assigned to that route receives full built-in Code UX MCP access, `scheduler_code_ux`, `add_long_term_memory`, and the default Playwright MCP server for dashboard reply turns even when its saved preset has Code UX disabled or no MCP policy. An explicitly narrowed dashboard reply policy still has both dedicated lanes forced on. This default is keyed to the dashboard reply route assignment, not to the generic `project_manager` runtime role.

Clarification tools add a separate audience boundary on the same gateway. `request_clarification` is limited to an assigned task agent, the manual coding route, or an `orchestratorAgentPresetIds` worker-pool member. `reply_to_clarification` is limited to the clarification-reply/dashboard-reply project-manager agent or an unscoped project-manager client. Agent-scoped calls must match the agent's project, and assignment-only workers must address their assigned task. Listing and calling share the same resolver, so unknown, ineligible, cross-project, and cross-audience requests fail closed with `MethodNotFound`.

## Worker Clarification Tools

Both clarification tools travel through the existing `project_manager` MCP gateway. Their `worker` and `project_manager` audiences are authorization boundaries on that gateway, not additional runtime roles. A narrow audience grant does not give a coding agent project-manager management tools, and a coding agent is never granted `reply_to_clarification`.

`request_clarification` accepts:

| Field | Required | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `projectId` | yes | Owning project; must match the authenticated agent's project. |
| `questionMarkdown` | yes | Non-blank Markdown, at most 16,000 characters. |
| `deduplicationKey` | yes | Stable, project-scoped idempotency key, at most 512 characters. |
| `taskId` | no | Task context. An assignment-only coding agent must supply its assigned task. |
| `sprintId` | no | Sprint context. |
| `sprintRunId` | no | Sprint-run context. |
| `dispatchId` | no | Task-dispatch context. |
| `taskRunId` | no | Task-run context. When present, Code UX derives and verifies the linked task, sprint, sprint run, dispatch, and session. |
| `sessionId` | no | Provider-session context. |

The requester identity is taken from the authenticated `X-Code-Ux-Agent` context and cannot be supplied in the payload. Every optional runtime reference is checked against `projectId` and the other linked records before the question is persisted.

```json
{
  "projectId": "project-123",
  "taskId": "task-456",
  "taskRunId": "task-run-789",
  "questionMarkdown": "Should the migration preserve legacy rows, or may it rebuild the table?",
  "deduplicationKey": "task-456:legacy-row-policy"
}
```

A successful request returns `{ "clarification": ... }`. A new record has `status: "pending"`; the public clarification id is the project attention-item id. Submitting the same key with the same requester, question, and full runtime scope returns the existing record in its current state without another attention item or duplicate task-run event. Reusing the key for different content or scope is a validation error.

`reply_to_clarification` accepts only the owning project, clarification id, and answer:

```json
{
  "projectId": "project-123",
  "clarificationId": "attention-item-abc",
  "answerMarkdown": "Preserve the legacy rows and use an additive migration."
}
```

`answerMarkdown` must be non-blank and no longer than 32,000 characters. The replying identity is derived from the authenticated agent context; unscoped project-manager MCP clients use the server's project-manager client identity. Agent-scoped replies are limited to the configured `clarification_reply` or `dashboard_reply` agent, with the built-in Project manager fallback used only when those routes do not both select another agent.

The normal server response contains:

```json
{
  "clarification": { "id": "attention-item-abc", "status": "replied" },
  "continuation": { "kind": "worker_clarification_reply", "answerMarkdown": "..." },
  "deliveryMode": "jules_message",
  "alreadySettled": false
}
```

`deliveryMode` is `jules_message` when the answer was accepted by the existing Jules session, `cli_workspace` when Code UX accepted a task-rerun continuation against the preserved local workspace and native session lineage, or `recorded_answer` for a taskless general question. These states confirm delivery or persistence, not task completion. The clarification becomes `replied` only after delivery/continuation succeeds. If a task-backed provider session, task-run scope, or preserved CLI workspace is missing or invalid, the call fails and the clarification stays `pending`.

Clarification records move from `pending` to one of `replied`, `expired`, or `cancelled`. A repeated reply to an already replied clarification returns the original settled result with `alreadySettled: true` and performs no second message or dispatch. Concurrent identical replies share the in-flight operation; a non-replied terminal record rejects a reply. Schema failures return MCP `InvalidParams`; disabled, unknown, wrong-audience, cross-project, or ineligible-agent calls fail closed with `MethodNotFound`; service validation and delivery failures use the management error envelope with `isError: true`.

## Common Response Shape

Successful responses return:

```json
{
  "content": [
    { "type": "text", "text": "..." }
  ]
}
```

Core and agent tool errors return:

```json
{
  "content": [
    { "type": "text", "text": "Error: ..." }
  ],
  "isError": true
}
```

Unknown tool names raise MCP `MethodNotFound`.

Management tool runtime and validation failures return a stringified JSON envelope in the same text content block and set `isError: true` on the MCP tool response:

```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"status\": \"error\",\n    \"domain\": \"tasks\",\n    \"action\": \"create\",\n    \"message\": \"projectId is required\",\n    \"errorType\": \"validation\",\n    \"field\": \"projectId\"\n  }\n}"
    }
  ],
  "isError": true
}
```

The parsed management envelope has:
- `result.status: "error"` for every management failure.
- `result.domain` and `result.action` copied from the failed management call.
- `result.message` as the developer-facing failure reason.
- `result.errorType: "validation"` for payload parser failures and `"runtime"` for dependency or execution failures.
- `result.field` when a validation helper can identify the invalid field.

Approval responses are not errors. Calls that need human confirmation still return `approvalRequired: true` and do not set `isError`.

Tool arguments are validated against `src/contracts/mcp-tool-definitions.ts` before dispatch. Invalid tool payload shapes, missing required schema fields, invalid enum values, and malformed approval envelopes fail as MCP `InvalidParams` errors before management action handlers run. Management action parser failures still use the standardized management error envelope described above, with sanitized validation messages and a `field` when the helper can identify one.

## Scheduler Tools

Code UX exposes two scheduler MCP surfaces:

- `manage_scheduler` is the project-manager management surface. It can list, create, schedule sprints, schedule quicksprints, schedule chat messages, update entries, delete entries with approval, and run due entries. It remains unchanged for project-manager clients.
- `scheduler_code_ux` is the restricted agent-owned surface. It supports only `list`, `schedule_wakeup`, and `cancel`. The Code UX suffix intentionally avoids collisions with scheduler tools exposed by provider CLIs or other MCP servers.

The restricted `scheduler_code_ux` tool accepts exactly one wakeup timing mode:
- `scheduledFor`: absolute ISO timestamp.
- `delaySeconds` or `delayMinutes`: positive relative delay.
- `wakeAfterReply: true`: schedule the wakeup for the current time so the dashboard chat runtime drains it immediately after the current reply is sent.
- `afterSprintId`: wake after the referenced sprint completes successfully, with optional non-negative `offsetMinutes`; failed and cancelled sources remain unresolved.
- `afterTaskId`: wake after the referenced task reaches a terminal project status, with optional non-negative `offsetMinutes`.

`schedule_wakeup` requires `projectId` and `bodyMarkdown`, and may include `title`, `timezone`, `threadId`, and `connectionId`. Completion anchors are persisted as `scheduleAnchor` payloads: `afterSprintId` maps to `{ mode: "after_sprint_end", sourceSprintId, offsetMinutes? }`, and `afterTaskId` maps to `{ mode: "after_task_end", sourceTaskId, offsetMinutes? }`.

When `schedule_wakeup` runs inside an MCP-backed dashboard chat turn, an omitted, null, or blank `threadId` defaults to the originating dashboard thread. Code UX persists that resolved id in `agentWakeupTarget`; an explicit non-empty `threadId` overrides the contextual default. Standalone MCP calls have no thread context, so the target remains threadless when `threadId` is not supplied. Both contextual defaults and explicit overrides remain subject to the normal project/thread ownership validation at delivery.

Every `scheduler_code_ux` entry is persisted as an `agent_scheduler` wakeup target. The runtime stamps `origin: "agent_scheduler"`, `source: "agent_scheduler"`, and `createdByAgentId` from the current MCP agent context. `list` returns only wakeup entries created by the calling agent. `cancel` changes the matching entry status to `cancelled` only when the entry is an agent-scheduler wakeup created by that same agent. Dashboard-created entries, `manage_scheduler` entries, entries without agent-scheduler metadata, task entries, and entries created by another agent are rejected with the standard management validation envelope.

The restricted tool intentionally does not expose due-entry execution, arbitrary update, recurrence editing, sprint scheduling, quicksprint scheduling, memory remediation scheduling, or global scheduler destructive controls.

## Custom Dashboard Management

`manage_custom_dashboards` exposes the custom dashboard repository and validation runtime to agents through stable management actions:

- `list`, `get`, `create`, and `update` manage project-scoped dashboard drafts.
- `create_revision` snapshots the current draft or provided bundle fields into an immutable revision.
- `validate_revision`, `validation_status`, and `validation_logs` delegate to the validation runtime.
- `publish_revision` publishes only a revision that is already marked passed with a valid report or a revision accompanied by a passed `validationSessionId`.
- `archive` clears any active publication and marks the dashboard archived. It follows the normal destructive-action approval fingerprint flow.
- `data_catalog` returns project dashboard summaries and declared source nodes for agents building or inspecting generated dashboards.
- `list_credential_slots` returns a bounded metadata-only review of declared slots, current bindings, backend health, and compatible credential candidates for the owning project. An optional `revisionId` reviews an immutable revision.
- `bind_credential` binds or replaces one declared slot by credential ID with `expectedBindingRevision`; `unbind_credential` removes one slot binding with the same optimistic guard. Both mutations require the stateful human-confirmation handshake. Their arguments are strictly validated and reduced to the allowed metadata fields before an approval fingerprint is built, so secret-bearing or unsupported fields cannot enter pending approval state.

Payload fields:

- `projectId` is required for `list`, `create`, `validate_revision`, `data_catalog`, and every credential-binding action.
- `dashboardId` is required for `get`, `update`, `create_revision`, `validate_revision`, `publish_revision`, `archive`, and every credential-binding action.
- `revisionId` is required for `validate_revision` and `publish_revision`.
- `sessionId` is required for `validation_status` and `validation_logs`.
- `validationSessionId` is optional for `publish_revision` and, when supplied, must identify a passed session for the same dashboard, revision, and project.
- `manifest`, `fileBundle`, `sourceNodeGraph`, `styleguide`, and `runtimeMetadata` are accepted by `create`, `update`, and `create_revision` according to each action's required fields.
- `tail` limits validation log output.
- `slotId`, `credentialId`, and `expectedBindingRevision` identify a metadata-only bind/replace operation; unbind omits `credentialId`. Secret-bearing and undeclared fields are rejected.

Validation sessions move through `queued`, `building`, `running`, `passed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`. `validate_revision` starts the detached Docker validation runtime; it does not publish the revision. A passed session means install, build, detached preview startup, and root health checks completed successfully.

`validate_revision` and `publish_revision` perform a fresh metadata-only credential compatibility review. Required unbound slots and missing, revoked, inaccessible, unconfigured, wrong-kind, insufficient-capability, or unavailable-backend bindings fail closed with slot-specific validation issues. Optional unbound slots remain valid. A rejected publication returns the sanitized slot-specific `issues` array in the error result without credential IDs or values. Only after that review does `publish_revision` apply the repository validation-state gate, so the prior published revision remains active on any denial.

Generic custom-dashboard MCP responses recursively redact known binding IDs from dashboard, revision, source, runtime-metadata, validation-report, file, and viewer-artifact content. Only `list_credential_slots`, `bind_credential`, and `unbind_credential` may return binding IDs and non-secret credential metadata. These actions never accept or return plaintext and never call credential secret resolution.

The generated dashboard data-source graph is user-declared JSON with `nodes`, `edges`, and optional `metadata`. Runtime viewer source types currently map to Code UX project execution data, project stats, overview telemetry, non-secret integration metadata, and unavailable `external_api` placeholders. Do not claim arbitrary external API connectors are available through this surface until a dedicated sanitized proxy contract exists.

For the user workflow, REST route list, detached runtime details, and rollback expectations, see [Custom Dashboards](../dashboard/custom-dashboards.md).

### Destructive Action Approvals

Destructive actions (e.g., actions starting with `delete_`, `reset_`, `replace_`) follow an explicit approval flow to prevent accidental data loss:
1. The initial call is sent without an `approval` block, or with `approval.confirmed: false`.
2. The server short-circuits the action, returning an early envelope with `approvalRequired: true` and an explanatory `approvalMessage`.
3. The server records a pending approval fingerprint for the normalized tool domain, action, scope identifiers, and payload. Scope identifiers include project, sprint, and task ids when present; settings fingerprints also include the setting path and proposed value.
4. The agent reviews the message and issues the exact same call again, but with `approval.confirmed: true` added to the payload.
5. The server executes the operation only when the confirmed call matches the pending fingerprint exactly and the pending approval has not expired. The approval is consumed before execution and cannot be replayed.
6. A confirmed call with any payload substitution, changed identifier, changed setting path, changed proposed value, meaningful array-order change, or `null` versus missing-field change is rejected with another approval-required response and does not consume the original pending approval.

### Settings Human Confirmation Gate

All mutating settings actions require a stateful human-confirmation step. This includes:
- `replace_system_settings`
- `patch_system_setting`
- `replace_project_settings`
- `patch_project_setting`
- `reset_project_settings`
- `replace_sprint_settings`
- `patch_sprint_setting`
- `reset_sprint_settings`
- `apply_settings_bundle` when the bundle contains provider credentials, git tokens, issue-tracker tokens, or login credentials
- `export_settings_bundle` when `includeSecrets: true` would export provider credentials, git tokens, issue-tracker tokens, or login credentials

Runtime behavior:
1. The first mutating settings call never changes settings, even if it includes `approval.confirmed: true`.
2. The server records a pending approval for the exact settings action, scope, setting path, and normalized payload for 15 minutes.
3. The response returns `approvalRequired: true` with instructions to ask the user for confirmation.
4. The client must not call the same endpoint again with `approval.confirmed: true` unless the user explicitly confirms the exact change.
5. After user confirmation, the same action and same payload can be called once with `approval.confirmed: true` within 15 minutes; the pending approval is consumed and cannot be reused.
6. A different settings payload, even for the same setting path, creates a separate pending approval and does not execute. Fingerprints preserve explicit `null`, explicit `undefined`, and array order, while object key order is normalized.

### Settings Synchronization Bundles

`manage_settings` supports settings synchronization through:
- `export_settings_bundle`
- `apply_settings_bundle`

Bundles use the existing `SettingsRepository` system, project, and sprint APIs. Applies are normalized through the same sanitizer and resolution helpers used by dashboard-saved settings, so imports do not persist raw unsanitized payloads.

Bundle metadata includes:
- `schemaVersion: 1`
- `exportedAt`
- `includedScopes`, containing `system`, `projects`, and/or `sprints`
- `fingerprint`, a SHA-256 fingerprint computed from a secret-redacted bundle representation
- `containsSecrets`

Export defaults to the `system` scope and redacts secret-bearing fields. `includeSecrets: true` may return provider API keys, git tokens, issue-tracker tokens, and login credential markers only after the one-use approval flow succeeds for the exact export payload. Bearer tokens are not generated by export; they appear only if they already exist in an explicitly approved settings payload.

Apply accepts a `bundle` object and optional `scopes` for partial import. Project entries must include `projectId`; sprint entries must include both `projectId` and `sprintId` so sprint overrides can be normalized against the resolved project base. Any bundle marked as containing secrets, or any bundle whose payload includes secret-bearing fields, requires the same one-use approval before persistence.

### Project Setup Action

`manage_projects` supports project setup with the nested setup request shape used by project creation and dashboard setup:

```json
{
  "action": "setup",
  "projectId": "project-id",
  "setup": {
    "enabled": true,
    "options": {
      "agents": true,
      "quicksprints": true,
      "previewScript": true,
      "ci": true,
      "techstack": true,
      "docs": true
    }
  }
}
```

For the `setup` action, clients may also send the normalized setup request shape directly on the project payload. The same `options.docs` flag is accepted there:

```json
{
  "action": "setup",
  "projectId": "project-id",
  "options": {
    "agents": true,
    "quicksprints": true,
    "previewScript": true,
    "ci": true,
    "techstack": true,
    "docs": true
  }
}
```

The deprecated `manage_code_ux` envelope delegates `domain: "projects"` setup calls to the same handler, so it accepts the same nested `setup.options` shape:

```json
{
  "domain": "projects",
  "action": "setup",
  "payload": {
    "projectId": "project-id",
    "setup": {
      "enabled": true,
      "options": {
        "agents": true,
        "quicksprints": true,
        "previewScript": true,
        "ci": true,
        "techstack": true,
        "docs": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

It also accepts the normalized setup request shape:

```json
{
  "domain": "projects",
  "action": "setup",
  "payload": {
    "projectId": "project-id",
    "options": {
      "docs": true
    }
  }
}
```

The action runs the Project Setup Agent and returns the applied artifact summary, including created agent IDs, created quicksprint template IDs, written project-relative files, `embeddedDocumentIds`, and `embeddedDocumentErrors`. `docs` defaults to `false`; when explicitly enabled, Code UX discovers repository documentation and ingests it through the Knowledge docs library without requiring the setup agent to return document contents. The Knowledge pipeline keeps its existing dedupe, extraction, chunking, embedding, and status behavior, so setup does not imply every document is already `ready`.

Docs embedding is best-effort. Individual file failures are reported as `{ "fileName": "...", "error": "..." }` entries in `embeddedDocumentErrors`; they do not fail the entire setup run or roll back provider-generated setup artifacts.

Dashboard calls can add `background: true` to the HTTP setup request. In that mode Code UX returns the created `invocationId` immediately and the invocation rail becomes the live tracking surface while setup continues.

### Project Creation Paths

`manage_projects` project creation uses the same initialization path as the dashboard. Git URL projects are cloned into the selected `cloneDir`, or `~/.code-ux/projects/<repo-name>` when `cloneDir` is omitted. `new-remote` project creation treats `cloneDir` as the clone parent directory and stores the project base directory as the single repository checkout root. `new-local` project creation resolves relative `sourceRef` values from the user's home directory and accepts absolute paths selected by the desktop picker without constraining them to the Code UX process working directory.

### Sprint, Task, and Settings Payload Normalization

For payload normalization in management tools, Code UX centralizes parsing behavior:
- **Required Strings**: Extracted via `parseRequiredString`. Must be present and non-blank (e.g. `"  "` is rejected). Returns trimmed string.
- **Required String Aliases**: Extracted via `parseRequiredStringAlias`. This preserves public aliases such as sprint `title` for `name` while failing with one shared validation error when both are blank or missing.
- **Optional Strings**: Extracted via `parseOptionalString`. Returns trimmed string, or `undefined` if blank.
- **Optional String Arrays**: Extracted via `parseOptionalStringArray`. Filters out non-string items and trims, returning `undefined` if the resulting array is empty.
- **Optional Numbers**: Extracted via `parseOptionalNumber`. Validates finiteness and optional min/max constraints.
- **Optional Enums**: Extracted via `parseOptionalEnum`. Normalizes case and whitespace to match allowed literal types.
- **Strict Optional Integers and Enums**: Extracted via `parseOptionalIntegerStrict` and `parseOptionalEnumStrict` when a supplied invalid value should be rejected instead of silently ignored. Omitted values still allow action-level defaults.
- **Required Objects**: Extracted via `parseRequiredObject`. The value must be a non-null object and not an array.
- **Required Present Values**: Extracted via `parseRequiredPresentValue` for patch-style payloads. The key must be present, but the value may explicitly be `null`; omitted and `undefined` values are distinct from `null` in approval fingerprints and patch application.
- **Validation Errors**: Parser failures throw `ManagementValidationError`, which the management tool handler serializes as the standardized `result.status: "error"` envelope with `errorType: "validation"` and `isError: true`.


The dedicated management tools (`manage_sprints`, `manage_tasks`, `manage_quicksprints`, `manage_scheduler`, `manage_node_flows`, `manage_settings`) share the same action handlers.

## Node Flow Tools

`manage_node_flows` is the project-manager automation-authoring surface. Governed actions are `catalog`, `get_node_definition`, `create_draft`, `patch_draft`, `validate_draft`, `create_custom_node`, `update_custom_node`, `validate_custom_node`, `request_credential`, `inspect_bindings`, `dry_run`, `publish`, `compare_versions`, `rollback`, `run`, `cancel`, `retry`, `inspect_run`, and `list_runs`. Compatibility aliases remain for `list`, `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `validate`, `get_run`, `attach_to_agent`/`attach`, and `detach_from_agent`/`detach`.

New drafts are not executable until published. `patch_draft` requires the last observed positive integer `draftRevision`; stale revisions return a `draft_revision_conflict` containing expected and actual revisions without writing. Draft review responses are summaries rather than full graphs: they include validation issues, policy findings, credential requirements, requested capabilities, side-effect diffs, node/edge counts, and the active published version. `publish`, `rollback`, and `delete` use the exact-payload, one-use approval handshake.

`dry_run` performs validation and policy simulation without executing nodes or side effects. It returns `executed: false`, redacted result metadata, and blockers such as missing or denied credential bindings. Credential actions return metadata only; decrypted credential values never cross the service or MCP response boundary. Custom-node validation reuses the governed project generator/build pipeline and returns checks, issues, capabilities, and credential slots rather than source bundles.

Operational `run`, `retry`, and `inspect_run` responses include durable node-attempt history. Each governed attempt projection contains its attempt number and status, failure classification and retry decision, executor and execution-invocation identifiers, artifact digest, timestamps, and redacted input/output. Credential values, credential bindings, and custom-node source are excluded. `inspect_run` reloads attempts from durable storage, so successful attempts, retries, terminal failures, and `attention_required` decisions remain inspectable after the original call or a runtime restart.

The graph payload is the shared `NodeFlowGraph` contract:

- `nodes`: `{ id, type, title, description?, position?, widgetSchema?, data? }`
- `edges`: `{ id?, fromNodeId, toNodeId, fromHandle?, toHandle? }`
- `inputSchema`: optional graph-level widget schema for run input
- `metadata`: optional JSON object

Validation checks graph shape, unique node ids, edge endpoints, acyclicity, JSON-safe node data, widget schema fields, select options, finite numeric constraints, and default values that match field types. The governed built-ins currently registered with executable handlers are `input`, `set_fields`, `template`, `provider_prompt`, `http_request`, `condition`, `switch`, `foreach`, `merge`, `delay`, `approval`, `email_draft`, `email_send`, `execute_subflow`, `webhook_trigger`, and `output`. A registered custom definition can execute only when its validated versioned manifest, immutable artifact, and custom-node runtime are available; unknown, legacy, mockup, and non-executable definitions remain planned or unavailable and are rejected by runtime dispatch.

Agents should build Code UX-adapted flows from structured graph specs instead of cloning n8n workflows one-to-one. A good flow exposes the values an operator or agent should edit, keeps runtime behavior repeatable, names nodes by Code UX behavior, and validates every required field before saving. MCP callers can provide `widgets` as a graph-level `{ fields: [...] }` schema or as node-id keys mapped to each node's `widgetSchema`.

Secret-safe widget guidance:

- use `secretRef` for credential references, not raw secret values
- do not put API keys, bearer tokens, cookies, passwords, or private headers in `graph.metadata`, `node.data`, widget defaults, run `input`, or examples
- use placeholder references such as `settings.provider.default` or `secret://service/token`
- treat MCP responses as redacted summaries; flow and run responses mask secret-shaped graph data, inputs, trigger payloads, node payloads, and outputs before returning them through MCP
- treat attempt history as an operational summary: it exposes invocation links and artifact identity, but never credential values, credential-binding ids, or custom-node source

Attach a flow as an agent skill:

```json
{
  "action": "attach_to_agent",
  "flowId": "flow-123",
  "agentPresetId": "agent-123",
  "skillAlias": "Review automation",
  "description": "Runs the reusable review node flow."
}
```

An attachment also gives that authenticated agent the narrow `run_attached_flow` capability. Its catalog entry contains only `flowId`, name, description, input schema, and `operation: "run_attached_flow"`; it never includes the graph or credentials. Execution verifies project ownership, the attachment, current publication, and credential policy, then records `initiatingAgentId`, the originating conversation id when present, and `triggerType: "attached_flow"` in run audit metadata.

Run a flow:

```json
{
  "action": "run",
  "projectId": "project-123",
  "flowId": "flow-123",
  "input": {
    "prompt": "Review the current diff"
  }
}
```

Create a small executable flow with graph-level run widgets:

```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "projectId": "project-123",
  "name": "Daily API Check",
  "description": "Fetches a status endpoint and returns a compact result.",
  "graph": {
    "nodes": [
      { "id": "input", "type": "input", "title": "Run input" },
      {
        "id": "request",
        "type": "http_request",
        "title": "Fetch status",
        "data": {
          "method": "GET",
          "url": "{{ input.statusUrl }}",
          "headers": { "authorization": "Bearer {{ input.apiTokenRef }}" },
          "responsePath": "status"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "output",
        "type": "output",
        "title": "Return status",
        "data": { "fields": { "status": "{{ nodes.request.extracted }}" } }
      }
    ],
    "edges": [
      { "fromNodeId": "input", "toNodeId": "request" },
      { "fromNodeId": "request", "toNodeId": "output" }
    ]
  },
  "widgets": {
    "fields": [
      { "id": "statusUrl", "type": "text", "label": "Status URL", "required": true },
      { "id": "apiTokenRef", "type": "secretRef", "label": "API token reference", "required": true }
    ]
  }
}
```

Use node-id keyed widgets when node configuration should stay editable in the dashboard inspector:

```json
{
  "action": "update",
  "flowId": "flow-123",
  "graph": {
    "nodes": [
      { "id": "request", "type": "http_request", "title": "Fetch status" }
    ],
    "edges": []
  },
  "widgets": {
    "request": {
      "fields": [
        {
          "id": "method",
          "type": "select",
          "label": "HTTP method",
          "defaultValue": "GET",
          "options": [
            { "label": "GET", "value": "GET" },
            { "label": "POST", "value": "POST" }
          ]
        },
        { "id": "url", "type": "text", "label": "URL", "required": true }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Validate a draft graph without saving:

```json
{
  "action": "validate",
  "projectId": "project-123",
  "graph": {
    "nodes": [
      { "id": "input", "type": "input", "title": "Run input" }
    ],
    "edges": []
  }
}
```

Inspect runs:

```json
{ "action": "list_runs", "flowId": "flow-123" }
```

```json
{ "action": "get_run", "runId": "run-123" }
```

Detach a flow from an agent:

```json
{
  "action": "detach_from_agent",
  "flowId": "flow-123",
  "agentPresetId": "agent-123"
}
```

### `manage_skills` persistent skill actions

`manage_skills` is the management surface for persistent project skill storage. It is available in the `agents_memory` category for project-manager clients and for agents with explicit Code UX tool access. It is separate from workspace files: callers save skill markdown through the MCP payload, and Code UX updates the SQLite query projection plus the storage's internal Git repository through `SkillService`. Git commits run through the standard helper container, and runtime mounts are read-only.

Available actions:
- `authoring_prompt`: returns the comprehensive skill-authoring prompt, including markdown/frontmatter format and the workflow for saving skills through `manage_skills` instead of writing into the workspace.
- `list_storages`: requires `projectId`; returns project-owned skill storages.
- `get_storage`: requires `projectId` and `storageId`; returns one project-owned skill storage.
- `create_storage`: requires `projectId` and `name`; accepts `description` and `storageKind` (`project` or `shared`).
- `update_storage`: requires `projectId` and `storageId`; accepts `name`, `description`, and `storageKind`.
- `delete_storage`: requires `projectId` and `storageId`; approval-gated. Deletes the storage, contained skills, embeddings, and agent attachments.
- `reset_storage`: requires `projectId` and `storageId`; approval-gated. Deletes skills and embeddings in the storage while keeping the storage and attachments.
- `list_agent_storages`: requires `projectId` and `agentPresetId`; returns the agent's enabled storage attachments and attached storages.
- `attach_storage`: requires `projectId`, `agentPresetId`, and `storageId`; attaches a project-owned storage to a project-owned agent preset.
- `detach_storage`: requires `projectId`, `agentPresetId`, and `storageId`; removes the attachment.
- `list_skills`: requires `projectId` and `storageId`; accepts `limit`; returns concise skill summaries, not full markdown bodies.
- `get_skill`: requires `projectId` and `skillId`; accepts `includeContent`. By default the response is concise; set `includeContent: true` only when the caller needs the full stored body.
- `create_skill` and `import_markdown`: require `projectId`, `storageId`, and `markdown`; accept `sourceType` (`manual`, `imported`, or `generated`) and nullable `sourceRef`.
- `update_skill`: requires `projectId`, `storageId`, `skillId`, and `markdown`; accepts `sourceType` and nullable `sourceRef`. The supplied `storageId` must match the skill's current storage because updates edit skills in place; moving a skill between storages requires a future explicit move operation. When `sourceType` or `sourceRef` are omitted, the existing skill provenance is preserved.
- `delete_skill`: requires `projectId` and `skillId`; approval-gated. Deletes the stored markdown and embeddings.
- `export_markdown`: requires `projectId` and `skillId`; returns the full reconstructed markdown with frontmatter.

Skill markdown uses YAML-like frontmatter followed by the instruction body:

```md
---
title: Review Discipline
description: Keep review findings concrete.
tags: ["review", "quality"]
appliesTo: ["src/services", "tests/backend"]
version: 1.0.0
---

Focus on bugs, regressions, missing tests, and rollback risk.
```

The parser supports scalar frontmatter fields and simple list forms for `tags` and `appliesTo`. The body is the authoritative instruction content. Metadata is stored in dedicated columns so `export_markdown` can reconstruct the markdown.

Updating a skill replaces its markdown-derived metadata and instruction body while keeping the skill in its current storage. The update path preserves existing provenance (`sourceType` and `sourceRef`) unless the caller explicitly supplies replacement source fields.

Create or import example:

```json
{
  "action": "import_markdown",
  "projectId": "project-123",
  "storageId": "skills-review",
  "markdown": "---\ntitle: Review Discipline\ndescription: Keep review findings concrete.\ntags: [\"review\"]\n---\n\nFocus on bugs, regressions, and missing tests."
}
```

Approval example for destructive skill deletion:

```json
{
  "action": "delete_skill",
  "projectId": "project-123",
  "skillId": "skill-123"
}
```

The first call returns `approvalRequired: true`. After human approval, repeat the same request with:

```json
{
  "action": "delete_skill",
  "projectId": "project-123",
  "skillId": "skill-123",
  "approval": { "confirmed": true }
}
```

Project isolation is enforced below the MCP handler by `SkillService` and `SkillRepository`. Storage, skill, embedding, and agent-attachment operations verify the supplied `projectId`; IDs from another project are rejected instead of being read or mutated.

### `search_skills` retrieval tool

`search_skills` is the retrieval-focused skill surface. It can be exposed to agents independently from `manage_skills` through per-agent MCP tool filtering. This lets an agent retrieve durable skill guidance without granting it storage creation, mutation, attachment management, export, delete, or reset capabilities.

When the MCP connection is authenticated as an agent, Code UX derives retrieval scope from that identity. The requested project must own the authenticated agent, caller-supplied `agentPresetId` must match it, and search is limited to the agent's enabled storage attachments. A direct `storageId` is accepted only when it is in that attachment set. Context-free project-manager connections retain the existing project-wide and caller-selected search behavior.

Persistent skill runtime behavior is documented with agent preset storage ownership in [Agent Preset Foundation](../architecture/agent-preset-foundation.md#data-model) and the Settings/Agents UI contract in [Agents Design System](../dashboard/design-system-agents.md#persistent-skills). The integration regression in `tests/backend/integration/persistent-skills-runtime.test.ts` covers the MCP retrieval contract together with repository attachments and provider runtime injection.

Schema:

```json
{
  "projectId": "project-123",
  "query": "review pull request risk checklist",
  "agentPresetId": "agent-123",
  "storageId": "skills-review",
  "limit": 5,
  "minSimilarity": 0.3
}
```

Fields:
- `projectId` and non-blank `query` are required.
- `agentPresetId` is optional. For an authenticated agent connection it may be omitted and, when supplied, must match the authenticated identity. For an unscoped project-manager connection, supplying it without `storageId` searches that project-owned agent's attachments.
- `storageId` is optional. Authenticated agents may select only one of their enabled project-owned attachments; unscoped project-manager connections may select any project-owned storage.
- `limit` defaults to 10 and is capped by the handler.
- `minSimilarity` is optional and must be between 0 and 1 when supplied.

Response shape:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "results": [
      {
        "similarity": 0.91,
        "skill": {
          "id": "skill-123",
          "projectId": "project-123",
          "storageId": "skills-review",
          "name": "Review Discipline",
          "description": "Keep review findings concrete.",
          "sourceType": "manual",
          "sourceRef": null,
          "tags": ["review"],
          "appliesTo": ["src/services"],
          "version": "1.0.0",
          "contentHash": "sha256...",
          "createdAt": "2026-07-07T00:00:00.000Z",
          "updatedAt": "2026-07-07T00:00:00.000Z",
          "summary": "Focus on bugs, regressions, missing tests, and rollback risk."
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Search responses intentionally return concise summaries. To retrieve a complete stored skill, call `manage_skills` with `export_markdown`, or call `get_skill` with `includeContent: true` when the caller has management access.

### `manage_memory` claim actions

`manage_memory` supports durable long-term memory claim management in addition to raw memory actions. These actions are available to `project_manager` runtime roles and let project managers create canonical project claims directly without a sprint ID:

```json
{
  "action": "create_claim",
  "projectId": "project-123",
  "claim": "Use dependency factory composition for service wiring.",
  "category": "patterns",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "durability": 0.85,
  "tags": ["architecture"],
  "appliesToPaths": ["src/services"],
  "sourceMemoryId": "mem-123"
}
```

`create_claim` writes the canonical `memory_claims` row and a project-scoped mirror memory whose source metadata uses `originType: "memory_claim"` and `originId` equal to the claim ID. The mirror memory content is the claim text, its category matches the claim category, and its strength is the larger of `confidence` and `durability`. This preserves compatibility with semantic claim search, which retrieves project memories first and hydrates active claims from that source metadata. When `sourceMemoryId` is provided, the action also links it as supporting evidence unless a more specific `supportType` and `weight` or `evidenceWeight` are supplied.

`update_claim` keeps the mirror memories aligned by updating their content, category, and strength after the canonical row changes. Claim search hydrates only active claims from mirror memories, so deprecated claims stop appearing in claim search without deleting their evidence history.

Available claim actions:
- `create_claim`: requires `projectId` and non-blank `claim`; accepts `category`, `confidence`, `durability`, `tags`, `appliesToPaths`, `sourceMemoryId`, `supersedesClaimId`, `supportType`, `weight`, and `evidenceWeight`. `category` defaults to `context`; `confidence` and `durability` default to `0.8`; direct claims use manual source metadata.
- `list_claims`: requires `projectId`; accepts `status`, `category`, and `limit`.
- `get_claim`: requires `projectId` and `claimId`.
- `update_claim`: requires `projectId` and `claimId`; accepts updated `claim`, `category`, `confidence`, `durability`, `status`, `tags`, `appliesToPaths`, and nullable `supersedesClaimId`; keeps project mirror memories in sync.
- `add_claim_evidence`: requires `projectId`, `claimId`, and `memoryId`; accepts `supportType` (`supports`, `contradicts`, or `supersedes`) and `weight`.
- `deprecate_claim`: requires `projectId`, `claimId`, and explicit `approval.confirmed: true`. The first unconfirmed call returns the standard `approvalRequired` envelope and does not mutate state.

Other `manage_memory` actions include `search`, `list`, `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete` (requires approval confirmation), `promote`, `start_reembed`, `get_map`, `count`, and `model_status`. Memory search includes project-scoped deduplication/idempotency behavior using similar internal guarantees to ensure overlapping requests don't duplicate state.

Claim reads and writes remain project-scoped. A claim ID or evidence memory outside the provided project is rejected instead of being linked across project boundaries.

### `add_long_term_memory` Project Manager lane

`add_long_term_memory` is the dedicated direct-write tool for the user-facing Project Manager. It is separate from the broad `manage_memory` lifecycle surface so an explicitly narrowed dashboard reply policy can still grant one safe, recognizable remember/learn operation.

```json
{
  "projectId": "project-123",
  "memory": "Use dependency factory composition for service wiring.",
  "category": "patterns",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "durability": 0.9,
  "tags": ["architecture"],
  "appliesToPaths": ["src/services"]
}
```

- `projectId` and non-blank `memory` are required.
- `category` accepts durable categories only: `architecture`, `codebase`, `context`, `preferences`, `patterns`, `decision`, or `learning`; it defaults to `learning`.
- `confidence` and `durability` are optional `0..1` values and default to `0.9`.
- `tags`, `appliesToPaths`, and a project-owned `sourceMemoryId` are optional. A source memory is linked as supporting evidence with weight `1`.
- Success returns the canonical `claim`, searchable `mirrorMemory`, optional evidence, and `richWidget = { type: "memory", data: ... }`. The Project Manager must re-emit those exact returned values in a `codeux:memory` fenced block for the chat UI to render the confirmation; it must not invent IDs.
- Validation and persistence errors use the normal structured MCP error envelope and do not claim success.

The tool is not a replacement for short-term sprint evidence. It is intended for explicit user persistence requests and Project Manager judgments that a stable fact, preference, decision, convention, or lesson should guide future work.

Destructive claim lifecycle example:

```json
{
  "action": "deprecate_claim",
  "projectId": "project-123",
  "claimId": "claim-123"
}
```

The first call returns `approvalRequired: true`. To execute the deprecation after explicit human approval, repeat the same request with:

```json
{
  "action": "deprecate_claim",
  "projectId": "project-123",
  "claimId": "claim-123",
  "approval": { "confirmed": true }
}
```

For sprint create/followup/update calls:
- `name` is the canonical repository field.
- `title` is accepted as a public MCP alias for `name`.
- `goal` is the canonical repository field.
- `goalMarkdown` is accepted as a public MCP alias for `goal`.
- `linkedIssues` can include imported issue body and conversation markdown. Sprint create merges that context into the goal under `## Linked Issues`; sprint update does the same when a replacement goal is provided. Prompt-only issue body and conversation content are not stored in linked issue repository rows.
- Missing or blank `projectId`, `sprintId`, `sprintRunId`, `name`, and `title` values are rejected before repository calls so MCP clients receive a validation error instead of a low-level `.trim()` failure.

### `manage_sprints followup`

Use `manage_sprints` with `action: "followup"` when a later sprint should be captured now but must not be planned until its scheduled start. The action accepts the same draft fields and public aliases as sprint creation, requires `projectId`, creates a sprint with `status: "idle"`, and returns the saved sprint record synchronously.

```json
{
  "action": "followup",
  "projectId": "project-123",
  "title": "Post-migration follow-up",
  "goalMarkdown": "Apply the findings from the migration sprint."
}
```

`followup` does not call the Planning agent, create tasks, start orchestration, or create a scheduler entry. To run it after another sprint, pass the returned sprint id to `manage_scheduler` with `action: "schedule_sprint"`, `scheduleMode: "after_sprint_end"`, and the source sprint id. Never call `manage_sprints plan` for that follow-up first: when the scheduled entry starts the still-unplanned sprint, Code UX plans it with auto-start at that time, after the source sprint has completed.

### `manage_sprints plan`

The direct MCP `manage_sprints` call with `action: "plan"` validates the project, sprint, and existing-task/replan preconditions synchronously, starts planning server-side, and returns this stable acknowledgement immediately:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "status": "started",
    "message": "Sprint planning started in the background. You will be notified when it completes or fails.",
    "projectId": "project-123",
    "sprintId": "sprint-123",
    "planningGuidance": {
      "status": "in_progress",
      "asynchronous": true,
      "isTerminal": false,
      "invocationId": "planning-request-id",
      "startedAt": "2026-07-13T10:00:00.000Z",
      "estimatedDurationMs": 180000,
      "estimatedCompletionAt": "2026-07-13T10:03:00.000Z",
      "nextCheckAt": "2026-07-13T10:03:00.000Z",
      "recheckIntervalMs": 60000,
      "sampleSize": 2,
      "isFallbackEstimate": false,
      "message": "Planning is running asynchronously. Exceeding the estimated completion time is not evidence of failure. Do not requeue, resubmit, or change settings while this invocation remains in progress. Check the same invocation again at 2026-07-13T10:03:00.000Z."
    }
  }
}
```

`planningGuidance` has this serialized contract:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | Projected planning state: `in_progress`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `cancelled`, or `paused`. Execution invocation `running` and `completed` values project as `in_progress` and `succeeded`. |
| `asynchronous` | Always `true`; the planning workflow continues beyond the management response. |
| `isTerminal` | `false` only for `in_progress`; `true` for every other projected state. |
| `invocationId` | Stable planning request/invocation identity that clients carry through follow-up checks. The initial acknowledgement may use a request identity until the durable invocation exists. |
| `startedAt` | ISO timestamp used as the estimate origin. |
| `estimatedDurationMs` | Calculated duration from recent completed project planning samples, or the shared three-minute fallback. |
| `estimatedCompletionAt` | `startedAt + estimatedDurationMs`; it is an estimate, not a timeout or failure deadline. |
| `nextCheckAt` | The recommended next status read. On the initial acknowledgement it equals `estimatedCompletionAt`; later in-progress reads set it to one minute after that read; terminal reads set it to `null`. |
| `recheckIntervalMs` | The subsequent in-progress polling cadence, currently `60000`. |
| `sampleSize` | Number of usable completed planning durations included in the estimate. |
| `isFallbackEstimate` | `true` when the estimate used the fallback instead of project history. |
| `message` | Actionable state guidance. In-progress text explicitly prohibits treating ETA overrun as failure or changing/requeuing active work; terminal text summarizes the projection. |
| `errorMessage` | Optional terminal failure evidence, populated from the invocation's available error detail and omitted when none exists or planning succeeded. |

The existing result fields `status`, `message`, `projectId`, and `sprintId` remain stable, and `planningGuidance` is an additive backward-compatible field. Its estimate uses the project's recent completed planning durations, with the shared three-minute fallback when no usable history exists. The acknowledgement means only that background planning started after synchronous validation. It does not mean tasks already exist, planning self-reflection has finished, or optional `autoStart` has completed.

A repeated `plan` call for the same project and sprint while that request is unsettled does not submit another provider request or attach another terminal callback. It returns `status: "in_progress"` with guidance to check again one minute later. `manage_sprints` `get` preserves every sprint field and adds `planningGuidance` while an in-memory request or sprint-linked planning invocation is available. A still-running request advances `nextCheckAt` by one minute on each read, even after `estimatedCompletionAt`; elapsed ETA alone never changes status or proves failure. Completed planning maps to `succeeded`; failed, cancelled, and paused planning surfaces its terminal state and available error detail. All terminal guidance sets `isTerminal` to `true` and `nextCheckAt` to `null`, so clients stop polling.

When the call originates from an MCP-backed dashboard chat turn, Code UX captures the originating agent and thread before the background promise settles. Successful completion then persists one existing due-now, non-recurring `agent_wakeup` targeted to that thread. The scheduler delivers the wakeup through the normal chat-agent path and asks the agent to review the generated tasks, recap their count, and state whether execution actually started. If planning fails, Code UX queues the same kind of same-thread wakeup with the failure reason and asks the agent to provide a concise failure recap.

The assigned Project Manager separately follows the returned check schedule with agent-owned, one-shot `scheduler_code_ux` wakeups: first at `estimatedCompletionAt`, then at each in-progress response's one-minute `nextCheckAt`. It lists before scheduling to avoid duplicates and never uses recurrence. While planning remains active it does not call `plan` again, requeue/resubmit work, change provider/model/settings, or treat absent tasks or ETA overrun as failure. When terminal guidance or the runtime-owned completion/failure wakeup arrives, it stops polling and cancels its obsolete pending planning-status checks for that invocation or sprint, without cancelling the wakeup currently executing. This prevents the runtime terminal wakeup and an already-scheduled ETA check from producing duplicate dashboard turns.

Standalone MCP clients have no originating dashboard chat-thread context, so they receive the same immediate acknowledgement without a completion wakeup. They should poll `manage_sprints` with `action: "get"`, or inspect tasks and relevant telemetry, to determine when planning and any requested auto-start work have completed. Status reads never create scheduler entries.

This asynchronous response applies only to the direct MCP `manage_sprints` `plan` action. `import_issues` with `planAfterImport`, dashboard planning routes, scheduled sprint planning, quicksprints, and internal callers continue to await planning completion.

### `manage_sprints import_issues`

`manage_sprints` action `import_issues` is the MCP contract for GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Notion, Asana, Linear, Miro, Lucid, Figma/FigJam, and Mural importer access. Internal MCP clients use it for search-only discovery, assigned-work searches, explicit ticket or external-object imports, linked sprint issue attachment, and optional planning after import.

Provider requirements:
- GitHub imports require a saved effective `git.githubToken` in system or project settings.
- GitLab imports require a saved effective `git.gitlabToken` in system or project settings.
- Jira imports require Jira integration settings: host/site URL, account email, API token, and usually a default project key.
- Notion imports require a saved effective `notion.apiToken`. `databaseId` can narrow page search or explicitly import a database.
- Asana imports require a saved effective `asana.apiToken` plus either `workspaceId` for workspace task search or `providerProjectId` / `asana.projectId` for project task fallback.
- Linear imports require a saved effective `linear.apiToken`. `teamId`, `teamKey`, and `providerProjectId` can narrow issue search when configured or supplied.
- Miro imports require a saved effective `miro.apiToken`. `boardId` identifies a board for board item imports, and `itemTypes` can narrow item types.
- Lucid imports require a saved effective `lucid.apiToken`. `documentId` identifies a Lucidchart/Lucidspark document; `search` can discover documents.
- Figma/FigJam imports require a saved effective `figma.apiToken` plus `fileKey` or explicit file keys in `externalIds`.
- Mural imports require a saved effective `mural.apiToken` plus `workspaceId` for workspace mural search or `muralId` / `mural.boardId` for a specific mural. Mural API support is beta/limited and may return only metadata and readable content available to the token.
- Importer workflows do not fall back to local CLI authentication. A locally authenticated `gh`, `glab`, or Git remote is not enough for MCP issue search, explicit import, sprint attachment, or planning import paths.
- External imports are read/attach only. Code UX does not transition, complete, close, write back, comment on, or otherwise mutate imported work items, boards, documents, files, or murals.

Search/import callers can provide `provider` (`github`, `gitlab`, `jira`, `notion`, `asana`, `linear`, `miro`, `lucid`, `figma`, or `mural`), `repository`, `hostDomain`, `workspaceId`, `providerProjectId`, `externalProjectId`, `asanaProjectId`, `linearProjectId`, `teamId`, `teamKey`, `databaseId`, `boardId`, `documentId`, `fileKey`, `muralId`, `itemTypes`, `projectKey`, `search`, `state`, `status`, `labels`, `assignee`, `assigneeText`, `issueKeys`, `issueNumbers`, `issueRefs`, `externalIds`, `includeConversation`, `limit`, and optional sprint attachment fields. `sprintId` and `attachToSprint` represent sprint attachment intent. `planAfterImport`, `autoStart`, `planningAgentPresetId`, `replan`, and `overrides` represent optional planning intent after import.

  "projectId": "project-123",
  "sprintId": "sprint-456",
  "provider": "github",
  "repository": "codeux-ai/codeux",

  }
}
```

Result shape:
- Search mode returns `mode: "search"` and populates `searchedIssues` with lightweight normalized issue summaries.
- Explicit-reference mode returns `mode: "explicit"` and populates `importedContexts` with prompt contexts that can include full issue body and conversation text. For Notion, Asana, Linear, and canvas providers, explicit imports use `externalIds` or provider-specific identifiers such as `databaseId`, `boardId`, `documentId`, `fileKey`, and `muralId`.
- When `sprintId` is supplied and `attachToSprint` is not `false`, the response includes persisted `linkedIssues` metadata records and the updated `sprint`.
- When `planAfterImport` is `true`, the response includes the optional `planning` result from sprint planning. `planAfterImport` requires `sprintId` because planning runs against an existing sprint.

Persistence and prompt behavior:
- `issueKeys` and Jira-style refs such as `OPS-123` resolve through Jira. `issueNumbers` and refs such as `#42` or `!42` resolve through GitHub/GitLab when `repository` and `hostDomain` are provided or inferable from the project.
- `externalIds` resolve through Notion page/database fetches, Asana task fetches, Linear issue fetches, Miro board/item fetches, Lucid document content fetches, Figma/FigJam file fetches, or Mural metadata/content fetches. Search results and explicit contexts normalize to linked-source records with `externalId`, `sourceKind`, stable display keys, source URL, preview text, metadata, and prompt markdown when readable provider content is available.
- Full issue body and comment/conversation text are merged into the sprint goal under `## Linked Issues` before planning so the Planning agent receives the complete context.
- Linked issue persistence stores metadata only: provider, repository or project key, issue key/number, title, labels, assignees, status, source URL, and related tracking fields. Full remote issue bodies and comments remain prompt-only data and are not stored in linked issue rows.
- Issue search and import are not destructive actions. Sprint deletion remains approval-gated.

For task create/update calls:
- `title` is canonical; `name` is accepted as an alias.
- `projectId` is required for list/create, and `sprintId` is required for create. List can omit `sprintId` to return all project tasks.
- Supported edit fields include `promptMarkdown`, `description`, `status`, `priority`, `executorType`, `agentPresetId`, `model`, `sortOrder`, `dependsOnTaskIds`, `isIndependent`, and `isMerged`.

For quicksprint calls:
- `manage_quicksprints` supports `list_templates`, `get_template`, `create_template`, `update_template`, `delete_template`, `execute`, and `start`.
- `start` is an MCP-friendly alias for execution with `submitMode: "plan_and_start"`.
- `execute` defaults to `submitMode: "plan_only"` when no submit mode is supplied.
- `taskCount` is the canonical task-number field for execution. MCP accepts it as a number or numeric string.
- `noTaskLimit: true` lets the planner choose the number of subtasks and disables the fixed-count prompt.
- `delete_template` requires approval confirmation. Custom templates are removed from the project template directory; built-in/default templates are hidden for the project by writing a local tombstone marker instead of deleting shared bundled assets.

For scheduler calls:
- `manage_scheduler` supports `list`, `create`, `schedule_sprint`, `schedule_quicksprint`, `schedule_chat`, `schedule_node_flow`, `update`, `delete`, and `run_due`.
- Generic `create` requires `targetType: "sprint" | "quicksprint" | "chat" | "node_flow"`.
- The `schedule_*` aliases infer the target type and accept flattened target fields.
- Both `create` and `schedule_*` actions support an absolute time via `scheduledFor` or an anchor completion event via `scheduleMode` (also aliased as `anchorMode`). Supported anchors are `after_sprint_end` (using `sourceSprintId` or `anchorSourceSprintId`) and `after_task_end` (using `sourceTaskId` or `anchorSourceTaskId`), both with optional `offsetMinutes` (aliased as `anchorOffsetMinutes`).
- Recurrence `frequency` accepts `minutely`, `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, and `monthly`; the dashboard renders `minutely` as `Minutes` and the matching recurrence summaries use labels such as `Every minute` and `Every 15 minutes`.
- Minute recurrence uses the same UTC scheduler math as longer intervals, so the normalized rule advances `nextRunAt` and expands occurrences exactly like other frequencies once the minute literal has been parsed.
- Scheduled quicksprints use the same `taskCount` number or numeric-string normalization as direct quicksprints.
- Scheduled chat messages use `bodyMarkdown`, optional `threadId`, optional `connectionId`, and optional `title`. When due, the scheduler posts through the same chat runtime used by dashboard conversations.
- Scheduled node flows use `flowId`, optional JSON object `input`, and optional `flowVersion`, either flattened or nested under `nodeFlowTarget`. When due, the scheduler calls the node-flow runtime with scheduler trigger metadata and only advances the entry after the runtime returns.
- `update` supports pausing and resuming entries via the `status` field. Resuming a `paused` entry to `scheduled` recomputes the next run time to the next future occurrence, preventing immediate execution of missed runs. Pause/resume acts as automation gating and does not manually trigger the target.
- `delete` requires approval confirmation.

For preview calls:
- `manage_preview` supports `list_sessions`, `start_session`, `rebuild_session`, `stop_session`, `remove_session`, `get_logs`, `get_url`, `get_script`, and `update_script`.
- `remove_session` requires approval confirmation.

For external chat provider calls:
- `manage_chat_providers` supports `list_provider_definitions`, `list_connections`, `get_connection`, `create_connection`, `update_connection`, `delete_connection`, `list_channel_bindings`, `create_channel_binding`, `update_channel_binding`, `delete_channel_binding`, `verify_connection`, `get_health`, `list_deliveries`, `retry_delivery`, `cancel_delivery`, and compatibility action `list_outbound_deliveries`.
- Supported provider kinds are `whatsapp`, `imessage`, `telegram`, `slack`, `microsoft-teams`, and `discord`. Each typed profile advertises only the `managed_bridge`, `webhook`, `native_bridge`, or `official_api` modes it implements. Official modes call profile-pinned provider endpoints; the other modes use operator-selected managed/custom/local bridges. Registry presence is not provider certification or production readiness.
- Connection responses return redacted credential metadata and generated ingress URL guidance; raw `secrets` are not exposed in success responses, validation errors, or approval envelopes.
- `delete_connection` and `delete_channel_binding` require approval confirmation.
- `update_connection` requires a one-use approval handshake before replacing secrets or changing executable/endpoint setup. `retry_delivery` also requires one-use approval. Preflight state is bound to the exact redacted payload and expires after 15 minutes.
- Channel bindings attach an external channel to a project with optional routing hints, inbound/outbound flags, and `suppressRichWidgets`. Multiple projects may share one external channel; runtime ingress uses selectors and records `disambiguation_needed` instead of guessing when no selector chooses exactly one project.
- `list_deliveries` inspects both directions; `list_outbound_deliveries` retains its outbound-only behavior. Results omit payload and lease fields and can filter by provider connection, binding, external channel, direction, status, and limit.
- `verify_connection` returns sanitized status, timestamp, capabilities, provider error code, retry state, diagnostics, and setup guidance. `get_health` reads persisted counts/outcomes only and never calls provider networks.
- Project scope is derived from each persisted binding/delivery rather than caller-supplied project IDs. Generated ingress URLs use `/api/chat-providers/ingress/:providerConnectionId`.

Create a webhook-backed connection:

```json
{
  "action": "create_connection",
  "providerKind": "slack",
  "displayName": "Team chat bridge",
  "bridgeMode": "webhook",
  "status": "active",
  "enabled": true,
  "setup": {
    "eventsUrl": "https://bridge.example.test/events",
    "appId": "app-generic"
  },
  "secrets": {
    "signingSecret": "replace-with-secret",
    "botToken": "replace-with-token"
  }
}
```

Bind a shared channel to a project:

```json
{
  "action": "create_channel_binding",
  "providerConnectionId": "connection-generic",
  "externalChannelId": "channel-shared",
  "externalChannelName": "Shared engineering channel",
  "projectId": "project-alpha",
  "routingHints": {
    "projectSelectorPrefix": "alpha",
    "aliases": ["alpha", "project-alpha"]
  },
  "inboundEnabled": true,
  "outboundEnabled": true,
  "suppressRichWidgets": true
}
```

Inspect retryable outbound delivery state:

```json
{
  "action": "list_outbound_deliveries",
  "providerConnectionId": "connection-generic",
  "externalChannelId": "channel-shared",
  "deliveryStatus": "retryable_failure",
  "limit": 25
}
```

Run the connection's bounded verification contract:

```json
{
  "action": "verify_connection",
  "providerConnectionId": "connection-generic"
}
```

Official Telegram `getMe`, Slack `auth.test`, and Discord current-user checks require explicitly configured test credentials. Meta send testing is a separate test-number opt-in. Teams verification coverage is deterministic Emulator/contract testing rather than a public sandbox, and iMessage has no provider-native bot sandbox. A credential-gated skip is not a successful live result.

A redacted timeout/failure result retains classification but not upstream URL, request/response body, signed data, identity values, or credentials:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "status": "success",
    "domain": "chat_providers",
    "action": "verify_connection",
    "verification": {
      "providerConnectionId": "connection-generic",
      "providerKind": "slack",
      "status": "failed",
      "verifiedAt": "2030-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "capabilities": ["setup", "authentication", "handshake", "outbound"],
      "providerErrorCode": "verification_timeout",
      "retryable": true,
      "issues": ["Provider verification timed out."],
      "diagnostics": null
    }
  }
}
```

Manual retry is a two-call approval flow. The first call returns `approvalRequired`; repeat the exact action/payload only after human confirmation:

```json
{
  "action": "retry_delivery",
  "deliveryId": "delivery-generic"
}
```

```json
{
  "action": "retry_delivery",
  "deliveryId": "delivery-generic",
  "approval": { "confirmed": true }
}
```

Cancellation does not send again and therefore does not require the retry approval:

```json
{
  "action": "cancel_delivery",
  "deliveryId": "delivery-generic"
}
```

Validation rejects unsupported provider/mode combinations, missing required IDs, non-object setup/secrets, and `limit` outside 1-500. Credential mutation/verification can be disabled for remote MCP clients. Binding and delivery operations authorize the project stored on the binding; an unauthorized principal receives a generic project-authorization failure rather than foreign delivery data. Provider 429/temporary failures return `retryable: true` with a sanitized retry schedule, while invalid authentication/permissions are terminal until configuration changes.

For settings patch calls, `value` may be any JSON value, including strings, booleans, numbers, `null`, arrays, or objects.
Settings patch, replacement, and reset actions all require the standard one-use stateful human-confirmation gate to prevent unauthorized execution environment modification.

## Important Runtime Behaviors

### Listen-mode behavior
- `listen` is now the primary listening contract for both normal stdio MCP clients and workers.
- `listen` registers or refreshes the connection, then blocks until one actionable event is available or timeout expires.
- `listen` returns exactly one event at a time: a dashboard message or a timeout result with explicit "call listen again" continuation guidance.
- `listen` now returns compact event payloads instead of full connection/message records:
  - dashboard messages: `id`, `threadId`, `projectId`, `bodyMarkdown`, optional `metadata`
  - timeout: continuation only
- The default `listen` timeout is derived from dashboard settings `sprintLoopSteps.watchLoopOutputIntervalSeconds` and currently defaults to `300`.
- The default internal idle polling cadence inside one blocking `listen` call is now `3000ms`, which reduces idle listener churn without changing the external MCP loop contract.
- Connection heartbeat writes are throttled while listeners stay idle, so a healthy long-poll listener no longer rewrites connection state every second.
- `listen` is exposed on the project-manager runtime over both stdio and HTTP.
- `start_listen` registers or refreshes an MCP connection in sqlite and returns pending dashboard messages for the active project.
- `pull_inbox` is the pull-based inbox endpoint for listening MCPs.
- `post_listen_reply` writes a connection reply back into the project conversation thread and marks the handled dashboard message as processed.
- `post_listen_reply` now returns only `threadId` and `deliveryStatus`, because the caller already knows the reply body and thread context it just submitted.
- `start_listen` and `pull_inbox` now remain as low-level compatibility primitives and should not be the first-choice listener workflow for normal human-driven MCP clients.
- New dashboard threads should remain unassigned by default until explicitly targeted or claimed by a real listener.

### Agent reply behavior
- `generate_dashboard_reply` generates a reply-only markdown response for a dashboard inbox message using the configured dashboard reply agent plus project context; the unset/default route resolves to the editable `Project manager` preset.
- `generate_dashboard_reply` also accepts `mode = compact_thread`, which treats the supplied markdown as a prepared compaction prompt and records the run as a `chat_compaction` invocation.
- `post_listen_reply` accepts optional `metadata`, which Code UX uses for hidden control-plane replies such as connected-worker thread compaction.

## Removed Legacy Surface

These legacy MCP tools are no longer registered:

- `get_source`
- `list_sources`
- `list_all_sources`
- `create_session`
- `list_sessions`
- `approve_session_plan`
- `send_session_message`
- `wait_for_session_completion`
- `get_activity`
- `list_activities`
- `list_all_activities`
- `task_agent`

Code UX now keeps orchestration inside its own DB-backed dispatch layer. External MCP clients interact through listener, inbox, dispatch, and control-plane tools instead of direct Jules session management.

## Stability Expectations

When modifying tool contracts:
1. Keep argument names backward compatible where possible.
2. Update both backend and dashboard types if shared payloads change.
3. Add or update tests in `tests/backend/**/*.test.ts` or `tests/dashboard/**/*.test.ts`.
4. Document changes in `docs/` and `README.md`.

## Jules API Client Typing Boundary

`src/integrations/jules-api-client.ts` is the typed transport boundary for Jules REST calls.

Current expectations:
- Request/response interfaces are explicit for all list and session APIs (for example `JulesListSourcesRequest`, `JulesListSessionsResponse`, `JulesCreateSessionRequest`).
- Pagination inputs remain MCP-friendly (`page_size`, `page_token`) and are translated to Jules REST query keys (`pageSize`, `pageToken`) inside the client.
- Session route normalization is centralized so all session-aware methods consistently accept either `123` or `sessions/123`.
- Client-level behavior is covered by `tests/backend/services/jules-api-client.test.ts` (query mapping, pagination, session normalization, API key handling).

## Runtime Tool Enablement

MCP tool availability is runtime-configurable from dashboard settings (`mcpTools`).

Behavior:
- Disabled tools are omitted from `ListToolsRequestSchema` responses.
- Calls to disabled tools return MCP `MethodNotFound`.
- Toggle state is persisted in settings storage and applied without server restart.

## Runtime Role Gating

Code UX now also filters tools by runtime role before applying dashboard toggles.

Current roles:

- `project_manager`

Behavior:

- Code UX now exposes only the project-manager tool surface
- the same tool list is used for stdio and HTTP transports

This keeps Gemini CLI and other regular MCP clients compatible without cluttering them with worker-local controls.
