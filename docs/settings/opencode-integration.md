# OpenCode Integration

Code UX supports OpenCode as a first-class virtual CLI provider alongside Gemini, Codex, Claude Code, and Qwen Code.

## Runtime Contract

- Provider id: `opencode`
- Default provider config id: `opencode`
- Default local auth path: `~/.local/share/opencode`
- Default model: `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`
- Docker fallback install: `curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash`
- Non-interactive command: `opencode run --model <provider/model> <prompt>`

OpenCode can be selected anywhere a virtual CLI provider is accepted: task coding, planning, dashboard replies, clarification replies, QA review, CI repair, and merge-conflict repair.

## Authentication Modes

Each named OpenCode provider instance stores an `openCodeAuthMode`.

### Local Auth

`LOCAL_AUTH` copies the host OpenCode auth directory into Docker when `mountAuth` is enabled.

This mode is intended for credentials created by OpenCode's `/connect` flow or `opencode auth login`.

The runtime mounts the configured `authPath` to `/opt/credentials/opencode` and copies it into `$HOME/.local/share/opencode` inside the provider container. The default path is `~/.local/share/opencode`, where OpenCode stores `auth.json`.

### Provider Key

`ENV_KEY` configures a built-in OpenCode provider with an API key. The selected model remains a normal OpenCode `provider/model` value, such as:

```text
anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
openai/gpt-5
github-copilot/gpt-5
```

Code UX injects an inline OpenCode config through `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` and maps the stored provider key to `OPENCODE_API_KEY`. The configured `openCodeEnvKey` is still used as an import hint when the saved key is empty.

### Custom Provider

`CUSTOM_PROVIDER` generates an OpenCode provider entry for OpenAI-compatible endpoints:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "custom": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "name": "custom",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://api.example.com/v1",
        "apiKey": "{env:OPENCODE_API_KEY}"
      },
      "models": {
        "model": {
          "name": "model"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "model": "custom/model"
}
```

This covers OpenRouter, LiteLLM, Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, private gateways, and other OpenAI-compatible services.

## MCP Tools

OpenCode reads MCP servers from the `mcp` section of its config. Code UX injects the management MCP server through the same `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` payload used for provider settings:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "code_ux": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:4444/mcp",
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

When the runtime connection has a bearer token, Code UX includes an `Authorization` header in that MCP entry.

## Docker Execution

Docker execution prepares OpenCode in the shared CLI bootstrap path:

- creates `$HOME/.local/share/opencode` and `$HOME/.config/opencode`
- copies mounted local auth from `/opt/credentials/opencode`
- passes `OPENCODE_API_KEY` and `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` into the container
- installs OpenCode if `opencode` is missing and fallback installs are enabled

The generated config is inline instead of written into a permanent host config file. This keeps one named Code UX provider instance from overwriting another instance's OpenCode settings.

## Dashboard Surface

The v2 Integrations page exposes OpenCode-specific setup panels:

- local auth copy from `~/.local/share/opencode`
- built-in provider key setup for standard OpenCode providers
- custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint setup with provider id, model id, package, base URL, and environment-key import hint
- masked generated config preview

Provider routing remains instance-based: multiple OpenCode instances can coexist, each with its own auth mode, API key, mount path, custom endpoint, model, weight, and route overrides.
