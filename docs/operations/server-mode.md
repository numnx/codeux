# Secure Headless Server Mode

Server mode runs Code UX as an authenticated MCP HTTP control plane without binding the dashboard UI, dashboard REST routes, dashboard realtime websocket, terminal websocket, or static dashboard assets. Use it for headless hosts, CI-adjacent automation, and cluster worker control planes where clients connect over Streamable HTTP instead of launching Code UX over stdio.

Server mode is different from ordinary `--headless` mode:

| Mode | Dashboard | MCP HTTP | Token behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Default dashboard mode | Enabled | Enabled by default | Uses an explicit token or the generated user token in `~/.code-ux/security.json`. |
| `--headless` / `--no-dashboard` | Disabled | Uses normal MCP HTTP enablement rules | Preserves local-development behavior and can use the generated user token when HTTP is enabled. |
| `--server-mode` / `CODE_UX_SERVER_MODE=true` | Disabled | Enabled by default | Requires an explicit MCP HTTP bearer token with at least 32 bearer-safe characters. |

## Threat Model

Server mode is still a single-user trusted Code UX runtime. Any authenticated MCP client can inspect and mutate projects, settings, sprints, tasks, memory, and execution state exposed through enabled MCP tools. It is not a multi-tenant service and does not implement per-user RBAC.

Use server mode when:

- the dashboard must not be reachable from the host
- MCP clients or workers need a stable HTTP endpoint
- a reverse proxy or private network boundary provides TLS and network admission
- operators can treat the bearer token as a secret with full runtime authority

Do not expose the MCP HTTP listener directly to the public internet. The Node listener is HTTP; terminate HTTPS with a trusted reverse proxy, tunnel, service mesh, or load balancer when traffic leaves the host.

## Startup

Generate the token in the process environment or a secret manager. Do not paste real bearer values into shell history, logs, tickets, release notes, or documentation.

```bash
export MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -base64 48 | tr -d '\n')"

codeux \
  --server-mode \
  --mcp-http-host 127.0.0.1 \
  --mcp-http-port 4445 \
  --mcp-http-path /mcp
```

For a cluster control plane behind a reverse proxy or private network interface:

```bash
export CODE_UX_SERVER_MODE=true
export MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -base64 48 | tr -d '\n')"
export MCP_HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0
export MCP_HTTP_PORT=4445
export MCP_HTTP_PATH=/mcp
export MCP_HTTP_MAX_SESSIONS=500
export MCP_HTTP_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS=3600000

codeux
```

The legacy `mcp-https` names remain supported for compatibility:

| Purpose | Preferred | Legacy-compatible |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gateway enablement | `MCP_HTTP_ENABLED`, `--no-mcp-http` to disable outside server mode | `MCP_HTTPS_ENABLED`, `--no-mcp-https` to disable outside server mode |
| Gateway host | `MCP_HTTP_HOST`, `--mcp-http-host` | `MCP_HTTPS_HOST`, `--mcp-https-host` |
| Gateway port | `MCP_HTTP_PORT`, `--mcp-http-port` | `MCP_HTTPS_PORT`, `--mcp-https-port` |
| Gateway path | `MCP_HTTP_PATH`, `--mcp-http-path` | `MCP_HTTPS_PATH`, `--mcp-https-path` |
| Bearer token | `MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN`, `--mcp-http-auth-token` | `MCP_HTTPS_AUTH_TOKEN`, `--mcp-https-auth-token` |
| Session cap | `MCP_HTTP_MAX_SESSIONS`, `--mcp-http-max-sessions` | `MCP_HTTPS_MAX_SESSIONS`, `--mcp-https-max-sessions` |
| Idle timeout | `MCP_HTTP_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS`, `--mcp-http-session-timeout-ms` | `MCP_HTTPS_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS`, `--mcp-https-session-timeout-ms` |

Server mode rejects startup when the explicit token is missing, empty, shorter than 32 characters, or contains characters outside the bearer-safe set. It does not fall back to the generated local user token.

If `--server-mode` is combined with an explicit MCP HTTP disable flag, server mode still restores the MCP HTTP listener on the default MCP port because the server-mode contract requires authenticated remote MCP access while the dashboard stays disabled.

## Health And Readiness

The MCP HTTP listener serves probes without the dashboard server:

```bash
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:4445/health
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:4445/ready
```

Use `/health` for process liveness. It only proves that the listener is up.

Use `/ready` for runtime readiness. It reports whether the Code UX runtime finished the required startup path and can accept work. During startup, maintenance such as Docker cleanup, preview reconciliation, branch reaping, and recovery work can continue after the listener binds, so `/health` can pass before `/ready`.

Do not include `Authorization` headers in probe logs. The probe endpoints do not require bearer credentials.

## Client Connections

MCP HTTP clients connect to the configured path with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The first JSON-RPC request on a new Streamable HTTP session must be `initialize`; the server returns an `mcp-session-id` header that the client echoes on later calls.

For a local CLI or dashboard-adjacent session that supports MCP HTTP, configure:

- URL: `http://<server-host>:4445/mcp`
- header name: `Authorization`
- header value: `Bearer <token-from-secret-manager>`

Verify without exposing the token:

```bash
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:4445/health
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:4445/ready
```

Then verify through the MCP client by listing tools or running a read-only management action such as listing projects. Do not use `curl -v`, shell tracing, or command transcripts that print the authorization header.

If a local dashboard app is used only as an operator console for a separate server-mode instance, configure its MCP client entry to the server-mode URL and bearer header. The dashboard UI of the server-mode process itself remains unavailable by design.

## Settings Synchronization

Settings synchronization uses the `manage_settings` bundle actions:

- `export_settings_bundle`
- `apply_settings_bundle`

Bundles can include system, project, and sprint scopes. Metadata includes `schemaVersion: 1`, `exportedAt`, `includedScopes`, a SHA-256 `fingerprint` computed from a secret-redacted representation, and `containsSecrets`.

Approved workflow:

1. Export a redacted bundle from the source runtime. Export defaults to the `system` scope and redacts provider API keys, git tokens, issue-tracker tokens, login credentials, and other secret-bearing fields.
2. Review the bundle before moving it to the destination. Redacted placeholders are expected and must not be replaced in shared artifacts.
3. If project or sprint settings are required, include `scopes`, `projectIds`, and `sprintIds`. Sprint exports require the owning `projectId` so imports can normalize sprint overrides against the resolved project base.
4. Apply the bundle on the destination with `apply_settings_bundle`. The importer persists through `saveSystemSettings`, `saveProjectSettings`, and `saveSprintSettings`, so values follow the same sanitizer and override normalization as dashboard saves.
5. For partial rollout or rollback, pass `scopes` on apply to limit which bundle scopes are written.

Secret-bearing exports and imports require the stateful settings approval flow:

- `includeSecrets: true` on export returns secrets only after the first response asks for approval and the exact same request is repeated with `approval.confirmed: true`.
- A bundle marked `containsSecrets: true`, or one whose payload contains secret-bearing fields, is applied only after the same one-use approval flow.
- Approval is bound to the exact normalized payload, expires after 15 minutes, and is consumed after one successful execution.

Rollback is another approved apply. Export a known-good bundle before changing a destination runtime, then apply that bundle back to the affected scopes if the rollout must be reverted. Do not rely on logs or chat transcripts as backups because redaction intentionally removes sensitive values.

## Cluster Workers

External workers connect to the server-mode MCP HTTP endpoint as control-plane clients. The worker process also starts a local `worker-host` runtime over stdio for execution on the worker machine.

Start a worker with the shipped bin:

```bash
codeux-worker \
  --server-url http://SERVER_HOST:4445/mcp \
  --auth-token "$CODE_UX_WORKER_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  --connection-key worker:build-node-01 \
  --display-name "Build node 01" \
  --project-id project-id
```

Equivalent environment variables:

```bash
export CODE_UX_WORKER_SERVER_URL=http://SERVER_HOST:4445/mcp
export CODE_UX_WORKER_AUTH_TOKEN="$MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN"

codeux-worker --connection-key worker:build-node-01 --project-id project-id
```

Worker config supports multi-project operation:

- repeat `--project-id` to register eligible projects
- repeat `--active-project-id` to advertise active project focus
- use a stable `--connection-key` so reconnects update the existing registered endpoint
- set `--server-command`, repeated `--server-arg`, and `--server-cwd` only when the worker-local execution runtime needs a custom command

Cluster behavior:

- Registered workers are not license-capped. The active Streamable HTTP session cap defaults to 100 and can be raised for large clusters.
- Project assignments live in `project_worker_assignments`. A project can have one primary worker and any number of overflow workers.
- Active-session protection prevents runaway clients from allocating unlimited Streamable HTTP sessions. Raise `MCP_HTTP_MAX_SESSIONS` only to the capacity the server can actually operate.
- Heartbeats derive endpoint status. Stale or offline workers are excluded from new claims, and stale primary workers can be bypassed by eligible overflow workers.
- Dispatch safety depends on both `task_dispatches` and `execution_leases`. A worker must not start local execution unless the server returns a claim with a lease token. Heartbeats renew the lease while the task runs; expired leases can be claimed by another eligible worker.
- Multi-project workers claim only work for projects they are assigned to and advertise as active or eligible.

## Token Rotation

Safe rotation is a short planned restart unless a reverse proxy or secret manager can coordinate old/new tokens externally.

1. Generate a new token in the secret manager.
2. Update client and worker secret references, but do not restart them yet.
3. Restart the server-mode process with the new token.
4. Restart or reconnect MCP clients and workers so they initialize new sessions with the new token.
5. Confirm `/ready` passes and clients can list tools or claim work.
6. Revoke the old token from the secret manager and remove it from local shells, process managers, and deployment manifests.

Existing HTTP sessions authenticated with the previous token should be treated as invalid after server restart because Streamable HTTP sessions are in memory. Workers should reinitialize rather than attempting to reuse old `mcp-session-id` values.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Startup fails with a server-mode token error | `--server-mode` or `CODE_UX_SERVER_MODE=true` is set without an explicit valid bearer token. | Set `MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN` or `MCP_HTTPS_AUTH_TOKEN`, or pass the matching CLI flag. Use at least 32 bearer-safe characters. |
| Startup fails when binding `0.0.0.0`, `::`, or a LAN address | MCP HTTP is reachable beyond loopback without an active token. | Configure an explicit bearer token and put TLS/auth network controls in front of the HTTP listener. |
| Dashboard URL is unavailable | Expected in server mode. | Use MCP HTTP clients and `/health` or `/ready`. Start a separate dashboard-mode process only when an operator UI is required. |
| HTTP returns `401 Unauthorized` | Missing `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, wrong token, duplicate authorization headers, or a client still using the old token after rotation. | Reinstall or update the client secret, reconnect, and avoid printing headers in diagnostics. |
| HTTP returns `400` on a new MCP session | The first request was not JSON-RPC `initialize`, or `mcp-session-id` / `x-code-ux-agent` was malformed. | Let the MCP SDK initialize the session, or clear stale session state and reconnect. |
| Session cap errors appear | Too many active Streamable HTTP sessions, usually from leaked clients or a cluster larger than the default cap. | Stop stale clients, shorten `MCP_HTTP_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS`, or raise `MCP_HTTP_MAX_SESSIONS` within server capacity. |
| Worker appears stale or offline | Heartbeats stopped, the worker process is down, network access failed, or the stable connection key changed unexpectedly. | Restart the worker with the same `--connection-key`, verify `/ready`, and check logs for bounded connection metadata. |
| Worker connects but does not claim work | No active project assignment, project not included in `--project-id` / `--active-project-id`, stale endpoint status, task executor mismatch, or no lease returned. | Confirm project assignment and worker status, then verify queued dispatches. Do not start local execution without a lease token. |
| `/health` passes but `/ready` fails | Listener is alive but runtime readiness has not completed or the server is degraded. | Wait for startup recovery to finish, then inspect structured logs. Use `/ready` for load balancer readiness gates. |
| Secret values appear in an exported settings bundle | The export was explicitly approved with `includeSecrets: true`. | Store the bundle only in approved secret storage, rotate exposed credentials if it was shared, and prefer redacted exports for review. |
