# Scheduler

The Scheduler page provides project-scoped automation for future sprint starts, quicksprint launches, and timed chat-agent messages.

## Dashboard Behavior

The route is available at:
- `/scheduler`

The page has two schedule surfaces:
- `Calendar` shows recurring entries on every visible day, not only on the original entry date.
- `24 Hours` shows the selected day as an hour-by-hour timeline.

The `Calendar` / `24 Hours` switcher is implemented as a two-tab control. It exposes the active surface with `aria-selected`, points both tabs at the scheduler view panel with `aria-controls`, and supports arrow, Home, and End keyboard movement. During refresh, the view panel keeps cached schedule entries and occurrences visible, marks the panel busy, and announces that cached data is being shown while the latest schedule loads.

Operators can create entries for:
- Sprints whose status is not `completed`.
- Built-in or custom quicksprint templates available to the selected project.
- Messages sent into `/chat` at the selected date and time.
- Long-term memory remediation, either deterministic or AI-routed through the Remediation route.

The Memory settings panel can also manage one project-scoped long-term remediation entry. That entry is marked with `memoryRemediationTarget.source = "memory_settings"` so the settings shortcut does not overwrite manually created Scheduler page remediation entries.

Scheduler target selectors, recurrence indicators, and repeating-count summary icons use the dashboard signal jade palette for interactive accents. Sprint and next-run status tones remain differentiated with their existing ember/status colors.

Target-type choices in the add/edit form are pressed controls. The selected target is exposed through `aria-pressed` and a polite selected-target announcement so operators can confirm mode changes without relying on color alone.

Repeating entries support:
- no recurrence
- minutely, hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly recurrence
- endless recurrence
- a fixed number of iterations
- an explicit end date/time

Minute-based entries use the `minutely` recurrence literal in the API and MCP payloads. In the dashboard form, that same option is labeled `Minutes`, and the recurrence summaries reuse the same formatter as other schedules: `Every minute`, `Every 15 minutes`, `Every 15 minutes, 5 runs`, or `Every 15 minutes until <date>` depending on the configured interval and end mode.

Minutely entries are not special-cased at runtime. They are persisted in the same recurrence JSON as other schedules, expanded into calendar occurrences with the same UTC recurrence helpers, and when due they advance `nextRunAt` by the configured minute interval before executing through the existing scheduler workflow. The scheduler service keeps the same execution path for minute, hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly entries, so the cadence only changes the recurrence math, not the runtime target handling. The separate memory-remediation cadence keeps its own off/daily/weekly controls.

## Backend Contract

Scheduler state is persisted in SQLite in `scheduler_entries`.

The shared TypeScript contract lives in:
- `src/contracts/scheduler-types.ts`

The persistence and runtime layers live in:
- `src/repositories/scheduler-repository.ts`
- `src/services/scheduler-service.ts`
- `src/domain/scheduler/schedule-time.ts`

The dashboard API routes are:
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/scheduler?from=<iso>&to=<iso>`
  - Returns persisted entries and expanded occurrences for the requested window.
- `POST /api/projects/:projectId/scheduler`
  - Creates a scheduler entry.
- `PATCH /api/scheduler/:entryId`
  - Updates status, timing, recurrence, or target payload.
- `DELETE /api/scheduler/:entryId`
  - Deletes an entry.
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/scheduler/memory-remediation`
  - Returns the settings-managed long-term memory remediation entry, if one exists.
- `PUT /api/projects/:projectId/scheduler/memory-remediation`
  - Creates, updates, or pauses the settings-managed long-term memory remediation entry.

## Runtime Execution

`SchedulerService` starts with the dashboard runtime and checks due entries on an interval.

### Pause and Resume Behavior

The scheduler supports gating automation through status changes:
- **Pause**: Setting an entry to `paused` disables automated scheduled executions. It does not delete the entry or its history.
- **Resume**: Changing an entry from `paused` to `scheduled` reactivates future automation. 
  - To prevent immediate "catch-up" executions of missed runs, resuming recomputes `nextRunAt` to the first future occurrence.
  - Resuming or pausing does not directly trigger the scheduled target; the target only executes when the recomputed due time arrives.

### Editing Scheduled Entries

Operators can modify existing scheduler entries without deleting and recreating them:
- **Hydration**: Clicking the **Edit** action next to a scheduled entry or any of its occurrences will populate the scheduler form with its current title, target type, target-specific values (sprint ID, template ID, task count, or chat message body), date/time, and recurrence settings.
- **Title Customization**: A customizable **Title** field is available. If left empty during creation or edit, a descriptive title will be automatically generated (e.g., `Run Morning Check`).
- **Target Validation**: All target-specific validation rules apply when editing (e.g., sprint selection must be a non-completed sprint, chat message cannot be empty).
- **Save and Cancel**: Submitting in edit mode sends a `PATCH` request to update the entry without triggering it immediately. The edit mode can be cancelled at any time to return to creation mode without mutating the entry.

### Due Entry Execution

Due entries execute through existing production paths:
- sprint entries call `ExecutionControlService.orchestrateSprint`
- quicksprint entries call `QuicksprintService.executeQuicksprint`
- chat entries call `ChatThreadRuntimeService.postMessage`
- memory remediation entries call `MemoryRemediationService.remediateLongTermMemories`

AI memory remediation entries create a `remediation` invocation record even when no cleanup candidates are found; in that case the invocation is completed with a skipped reason instead of dispatching an empty provider request.

After a successful run, the service advances `nextRunAt` from the scheduled occurrence time. One-time entries move to `completed`; recurring entries stay `scheduled` until their count or end date/time is exhausted. Failed entries move to `failed` with `lastError` for operator visibility.
