# Tasks Page Design System

Task board implementation must also follow the pure dashboard view-model and rendering performance contracts in [Code Quality And Performance Contracts](../architecture/code-quality-performance-contracts.md).

## Core Aesthetic: Refined Production Board

The Tasks page and Kanban board should feel like a 'Refined Production Board'. It prioritizes clear state scannability, exact layout, and reduced visual noise.

## 1. Board & Lanes
*   **Containers:** Use precise framing with subtle inner shadows and distinct but calm borders (e.g., `border-black/[0.06] dark:border-white/[0.06]`).
*   **Headers:** Lane headers should establish hierarchy using `font-display` for main titles and monospace text (`font-mono`) for metadata (like counts or tags).
*   **Counts:** Use restrained chips for counts (e.g., `bg-black/[0.03] dark:bg-white/[0.03]`) rather than bold solid colors, unless indicating a critical bottleneck.
*   **Empty States:** Empty lanes should be visually quiet, with dotted borders or subtle backgrounds to indicate they are active but empty, avoiding heavy text.
*   **Drop Behavior:** Pointer drops are status transitions only. Dropping a card onto another visible lane resolves to that lane's default persisted status (`pending`, `in_progress`, or `completed`), while same-lane drops are no-ops because task ordering is not persisted by the task API.
*   **Filtered Feedback:** Status filters, priority filters, sprint scope, and visible-card windows must expose `aria-live="polite"` summaries when their selected state changes. Empty lanes should announce that the lane is empty after current filters, in the selected sprint, or in the project, and should keep a stable minimum height so filter transitions do not collapse the board.
*   **Motion Contracts:** Board lists use the tokenized interaction contracts consistently: `controlFeedback` for local chip and control feedback, `selectionMovement` for active filter and sprint selection movement, `listReveal` for selector popovers and newly revealed lists, and `listReorder` for card/lane reorder transitions. Reduced-motion mode resolves those token durations to zero and must retain the same static state text, borders, and focus rings.

## 2. Kanban Cards
*   **Structure:** Cards must have consistent internal spacing. Align title, priority, status, dependency, execution metadata, assignee/agent, and progress information cleanly.
*   **Elevation:** Default to a flat appearance with a subtle hairline border (`border border-black/[0.06]`).
*   **Hover State:** On hover, elevate the card slightly (`scale-102` or `translate-y-[-2px]`), increase shadow (`shadow-[0_4px_24px_rgba(0,0,0,0.12)]`), and potentially add a very soft background tint (e.g., `bg-signal-500/[0.02]`).
*   **Typography:** Task titles (`h4`) should be highly legible, slightly condensed (`tracking-tight`), and robust (`font-bold`). To prevent unbroken strings from causing horizontal overflow in narrow components (e.g., task cards), apply `break-words` and `whitespace-normal` to multiline text elements like titles.
*   **Truncation:** Ensure long text in tags (like source, agent name, dependency titles) properly truncates without breaking layout (`truncate max-w-[...]`). When placing dense data components (like feeds, IDs, or stat grids) inside responsive grid columns, apply `min-w-0` to the internal flex/grid sub-layout containers. Without it, nested containers default to `min-width: auto` and will horizontally expand the parent grid.
*   **Quick Actions:** Task card quick actions stay mounted and keyboard reachable at all times. Fine-pointer hover may increase contrast or emphasis, but required actions must not depend on hover. Each action uses a stable icon slot, stable text slot, fixed minimum hit target, target-specific accessible name, and a disabled reason exposed through `aria-describedby` when unavailable.
*   **Pending State:** Optimistic saves and dispatch-like pending states must suppress duplicate activation. Use inert buttons rather than actionable links while a task action is pending, expose `aria-busy`, keep the button in the same location, and announce the reason without resizing the card.

## 3. Status & Execution Metadata
*   **Unified Status System:** All task-related metadata—priority, dependencies, and execution state—must share a consistent visual language.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   Completed: Green accent (`bg-status-green/[0.08] text-status-green`).
    *   In Progress/Ready: theme-specific signal accent (`bg-signal-500/[0.08] text-signal-500`).
    *   Blocked/Pending: Muted slate (`bg-slate-400/[0.08] text-slate-500`).
    *   Unknown dependency records must render a visible `Unknown` label with dashed neutral styling, not only a missing color state.
    *   QA-failed dependencies must use error semantics and visible `QA failed` copy, while pending dependencies use a visible `Blocked` label and warning semantics.
*   **Execution Meta:** Use distinct but subtle icons (Cpu, User) and uniform spacing.
*   **Live Metadata:** Runtime duration, PR availability, QA review state, and dependency blocker state must be visible or available as text equivalents and announced politely when they change. Default Auto executor metadata should not become prominent visible card content; keep it available only where it adds context, such as screen-reader metadata or detailed execution surfaces.

## 4. Compose & Edit Affordances (Modals/Composers)
*   **Surface:** Use glassmorphism (`backdrop-blur-2xl bg-white/78 dark:bg-void-800/72`) for the main composer surface.
*   **Fields:** Form fields should have clear hit areas, distinct borders that highlight on focus (`focus-visible:ring-signal-500`), and consistent typography.
*   **Validation:** Error states must be visually distinct but non-disruptive, using red accents (`text-red-500`) and clear iconography (AlertCircle) below or beside the field. Ensure text does not cause layout jumping.

## 5. General Rules
*   **Accessibility:** Preserve `focus-visible` styles on all interactive elements. Use `sr-only` text for screen readers where visual data is primarily conveyed via color or icons. Task cards must use `aria-live="polite"` regions to announce status changes (optimistic, pending, QA review, dependency blocker resolution, PR availability, and live runtime availability). Keyboard reordering is not currently supported; if draggable elements are pointer-only or disabled by reduced motion/saving state, this must be explicitly stated in `.sr-only` text and preserved in the card accessible context instead of adding low-value visible metadata chips. Action controls must remain visible and reachable without hover; hover and `focus-within` may only enhance an already available control group. For row-level action controls, always include the specific item's name or identifier in the `aria-label` and `title` attributes.
*   **Pending Actions:** Task card and active-stream row controls must suppress duplicate activation while pending or disabled. Expose the target task and reason through native `disabled` where possible, `aria-busy`, `aria-describedby`, visible or screen-reader-readable reason text, and stable hit-target dimensions.
*   **Layout Constraints:** When configuring responsive grids for dense content like Kanban boards, default to a single-column layout on mobile and delay switching to multiple columns until larger viewports (e.g., `lg:` or `xl:` breakpoints) to ensure individual columns remain wide enough to be readable.
*   **Motion:** Respect `isReducedMotion` or `prefers-reduced-motion` for hover elevations and transitions. Task cards use `controlFeedback` for local actions/status affordances and `listReorder` for card movement; reduced motion must retain static status badges, QA/dependency copy, edit/delete actions, PR/live metadata, and screen-reader drag-disabled guidance.
*   **Responsiveness:** Use responsive wrapping (`flex-wrap`) on control bars and footers to ensure labels, metadata, controls, and PR links do not overlap or break layout on narrow viewports. Ensure dropdowns and text elements use `min-w-0` and `truncate` or `break-words` safely so they don't blow out the viewport or board layout. Kanban columns should collapse to a single column on phones and only switch to two columns on larger viewports when readable (e.g. `lg:grid-cols-2`).
*   **Architecture (View Models):** Maintain a clear view-model boundary for task board rendering (e.g., using `buildTaskBoardViewModel`). Ensure filtering, enrichment, column counts, and card view-model construction are extracted into pure helpers rather than recalculating them piecemeal inside `TasksPage` components.
*   **Architecture (Controller Hook):** `dashboard/src/v2/hooks/use-task-board-controller.ts` owns task-board orchestration for `TasksPage`: project/sprint/task data hooks, route sprint query synchronization (`sprintId` and legacy `sprint`), effective settings, agent presets, filters, list window state, optimistic create/update/drop state, refreshes, and rollback cleanup. `TasksPage` should consume the returned typed view model and callbacks, keeping only page layout, DOM refs, and GSAP effects local.
