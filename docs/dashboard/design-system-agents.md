# Code UX Dashboard: Agents Design System

## Core Aesthetic
The Agents management surface leans into a premium "Workshop" feel. We use a lot of glassmorphism (`backdrop-blur-md` to `backdrop-blur-2xl`), very soft explicit gradients based on the agent's accent colors, and precise, delicate borders. Empty states should feel intentional, not like missing content.

## Content Privacy
- Never show real user/customer/live project names in screenshots, examples, test fixtures, PR notes, or design docs. Use generic labels such as `live project`, `customer project`, `non-test project`, or `approved local test project`.
- Agent preset examples should avoid names, repository paths, or goals that identify a real project. Generalize them before publishing.

## Color & Transparency Rules
- **Base Cards (Unselected):** `bg-white/55 border-black/[0.06] backdrop-blur-xl`.
- **Selected Cards:** `bg-white/85 border-signal-500/40 shadow-[0_8px_32px_rgba(0,224,160,0.12)]`.
- **Dark Mode Cards:** Ensure proper translation, typically using `bg-void-800/40` to `bg-void-800/75`.
- **Dashed Borders (Empty/New files):** Use `border-dashed border-black/[0.1]` in light mode.

## Interaction & State (Hover & Focus)
- **Hover on Interactive Cards:** Shift cards up (`hover:-translate-y-0.5`), intensify shadows (`hover:shadow-[0_8px_24px_...]`), and tint background (`hover:bg-white/80`).
- **Focus Rings:** Ensure all buttons have explicit `focus:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-signal-500/30`.
- **Header Actions:** Keep agent-management actions compact, pill-shaped, and visually consistent; secondary actions such as "Pull from files" and "Push to files" should share the same muted glass button treatment so the header reads as one control cluster. Do not use generic "sync" labels.

## Avatar Scene Motion
- The 3D agent avatar uses standard Three.js materials, studio lights, pointer-aware head movement, and runtime tool props. Do not add flashlight beams, target glows, low-battery flicker overlays, or shell/screen emissive boosts that recolor the avatar.
- The shared SVG/WebGL expression vocabulary is exactly `happy`, `sad`, `angry`, `sleepy`, `bored`, `hyped`, `shake_head`, `nod`, `curious`, `thinking`, `excited`, `laughing`, `surprised`, `wink`, `dance`, and `proud`. Response metadata separates semantic `emotion` from choreography `animation`: the supported animation identifiers map to expressions as `hyped` → `hyped`, `shake_head` → `shake_head`, `nod` → `nod`, `laughing` → `laughing`, `wink` → `wink`, and `dance` → `dance`; while an animation is active, that mapped expression drives choreography without changing the stored semantic emotion.
- Runtime props use the typed `agent-scene-tools` catalog for the stable `screwdriver`, `jackhammer`, `wrench`, `hammer`, and `torch` identifiers. Their user-facing labels are **Power screwdriver**, **Jackhammer**, **Open-end wrench**, **Claw hammer**, and **Welding torch**. The catalog owns each prop's stage anchor, contrast palette, geometry parts, animation references, and elapsed-time motion kind (`spin`, `piston`, `ratchet`, `tap`, or `flicker`); `?stageTool=<identifier>` remains the design-review override and ignores unsupported values.
- Tool swaps animate the previous prop out and the next prop in without rebuilding the renderer. Once an exit completes, the scene removes the old subtree and disposes every reachable geometry, material, and texture exactly once.
- Reduced-motion and explicit fallback paths do not load or create WebGL and render the static SVG avatar instead. WebGL construction failure switches to the same SVG fallback. When a runtime tool is active, the fallback exposes both a visible tool label and a `role="img"` accessible label, so tool state is not communicated by motion alone.
- `LazyAgentAvatarScene` waits until the host approaches the viewport (`IntersectionObserver` with a 160px root margin) unless `eager` is true; lack of `IntersectionObserver` loads immediately. Suspense, offscreen, reduced-motion, and explicit fallback states all use the same semantic SVG placeholder.
- New avatar scene geometries, materials, textures, and lights must follow the existing `AgentAvatarScene` lifecycle split. Mount creates one renderer, scene, camera, persistent light set, resize/pointer listeners, and animation frame loop. Avatar configuration changes dispose and rebuild only the avatar group, particles, and environment map. Tool changes independently move the prior tool to its exit phase and build the next tool. Animation reads refs so configuration swaps do not restart the WebGL context.
- Cleanup cancels animation frames and gaze timers, removes listeners and the canvas, disposes each reachable geometry/material/texture once, disposes particle resources and completed tool subtrees, calls `forceContextLoss()` when available, and disposes the renderer. Shared materials/textures are de-duplicated during traversal to avoid double disposal.

## Avatar Surface Validation

Run `pnpm run typecheck:dashboard` when expression, animation, work tool, fallback, or linked contract examples change. Run `pnpm run check:docs-web` after matching public documentation is updated. Reduced-motion and WebGL fallback reviews must confirm that the static expression, work-tool label, accessible image name, and surrounding controls remain available without animation.

## Badges and Sync States
Use explicit badging inside `.code-ux/agents` lists:
- **Active / Primary Label:** `border-signal-500/30 bg-signal-500/10 text-signal-600 shadow-sm`.
- **Synced:** `border-black/[0.08] bg-white/80 text-slate-500 shadow-sm`.
- **Out of Sync:** `border-amber-400/30 bg-amber-400/15 text-amber-600`.
- **Missing Source:** `border-status-red/20 bg-status-red/8 text-status-red`.
- **Persistent Skills:** show `Default off` until the agent has at least one attached skill storage and retrieval is explicitly enabled. The built-in Project Manager is seeded with one enabled default storage, while a later opt-out remains authoritative. Do not reuse memory colors or place this status inside memory filter controls.

## Base-Agent Update Notices
- Render one amber `role="alert"` notice per pending Planning agent or Project manager compatibility update. Do not extend this notice system to Worker, Quality assurance agent, or Project Setup Agent.
- While notices load, show the polite status copy **Checking for base-agent updates...**. A notice-discovery failure is fail-soft: keep the roster usable, log the failure, and do not replace the page with an error state.
- The heading copy is **Planning agent base update available** or **Project manager base update available**. Customized targets say **<selected agent> has customized <role> instructions and must be updated.** Alternate targets say **<selected agent> is assigned to the <role> route and must be updated.** Always use the selected routed preset's name, not the built-in fallback's name.
- Keep the explanatory guarantee visible: **Updating invokes an agent to compare both base files and apply only important system-compatibility instructions. Your main prompt, custom instructions, and behavior are preserved.** The action label is **Update with AI**, with an accessible name of **Update <selected agent> with AI**.
- Activation is explicit and provider-assisted; loading the page never invokes the provider. While an update runs, disable all base-update actions and show **Updating...**. On success, refresh both presets and notices. On failure, keep the notice visible and expose the existing retry feedback.
- The backend guard is part of the UX contract: only compatibility-critical instruction additions are accepted, every original selected-preset line must remain in order, and Code UX—not the provider—owns the write. Avatar, labels, routing, provider/model, memory, MCP access, persistent skills, source metadata, the user's main prompt, and custom behavior are preserved.

## Persistent Skills
- Persistent skill storage is a separate agent capability from workspace memory and knowledge subscriptions. The editor/detail panels must present it as storage attachments with durable storage names, not as ordinary memory filters.
- The editor shows an explicit retrieval toggle plus checkboxes for storage attachment. The toggle is disabled when no storage is attached, and saving must persist both `persistentSkillStorageIds` and `persistentSkillStorage.enabled`.
- The detail panel summarizes attached storages and the opt-in state. Empty state copy should say no storage is attached rather than implying memory is unavailable.
- Attached storage chips disclose bounded storage descriptions, skill counts, names, tags, and short content previews after pointer hover, keyboard focus, click, or Enter activation. Loading, empty, retryable error, preview truncation, and server-truncation states must remain explicit; detached storages never trigger a contents request. Disclosure activation only inspects or retries content; the adjacent checkbox is the sole attachment control.
- Storage disclosure must use the project-scoped summary endpoint only. It renders at most four skills, three tags per skill, and 180 preview characters in the current UI, never fetches full markdown bodies or filesystem paths, and never adds a full-body storage fetch to the Agents page.
- All add/remove/attach controls need visible labels, keyboard focus rings, and non-hover-only state. Storage chips may truncate long names, but retain the full accessible name and keep the visible section title and `Default off` / `Enabled` status readable on mobile.
- Opted-in agents with at least one attached storage receive exactly one persistent-skill prompt context, project-and-agent-scoped retrieval across those attachments, and isolated mounts on supported provider-routed and direct worker-inbox invocations. Disabled, unattached, cross-project, and agent-unscoped invocations receive none of those capabilities; this does not change their memory templates, knowledge subscriptions, or separately configured MCP access.
- Settings > Agents owns the project storage management and per-agent attachment controls. Storage CRUD and attachment changes are immediate preset/storage API mutations, while routing and self-reflection fields remain in the ordinary Settings draft and Save flow. The regression in `tests/dashboard/v2/settings-agents-persistent-skills.test.tsx` verifies that attachment edits generate `updateAgentPreset` payloads containing both `persistentSkillStorageIds` and `persistentSkillStorage.enabled`, while self-reflection criteria edits remain in the project settings save payload.
- Backend ownership and MCP/runtime behavior are documented in [Agent Preset Foundation](../architecture/agent-preset-foundation.md#data-model) and [MCP Tools and Contracts](../mcp/tools-and-contracts.md#search_skills-retrieval-tool).

## MCP Access
- Missing per-agent MCP access must display as default-deny: Code UX built-in tools are off, and custom MCP links are shown independently from built-in Code UX access.
- The editor must not enable Code UX directly from the inactive chip. It should open the MCP manager so the visible risk warning is presented before the user grants built-in tools.
- Enabling Code UX from the manager for the dashboard reply agent enables the built-in MCP surface plus `scheduler_code_ux`.
- Enabling Code UX from the manager for non-dashboard agents starts with every built-in tool represented explicitly and `scheduler_code_ux` disabled by default. Planning, coding, QA, CI repair, merge-conflict, and other non-chat agents need stronger visible warning copy because Code UX scheduler access can create agent-owned wakeups during operational workflows.

## Empty States
For empty states on the Agents page, avoid generic `<EmptyState />` implementations. Instead, use tailored rounded containers (`rounded-[1.9rem]`), dashed borders (`border-dashed border-black/[0.08]`), and a highly blured backdrop (`backdrop-blur-2xl`) that houses an oversized icon container (`h-16 w-16 bg-signal-500/10 text-signal-600 shadow-sm ring-1 ring-slate-900/5`).

## Responsive Layouts
- Use `flex-col-reverse` for primary-secondary layouts so side panels (like roster) stack below editors on small viewports.
- Apply `min-w-0` aggressively in `flex` containers and flex children where text truncation is required.
- Ensure action button clusters wrap natively using `flex-wrap` and preserve alignment.
