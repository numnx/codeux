# Interaction Patterns

The dashboard UI uses a set of shared interaction tokens to ensure standard easing, timing, and reduced-motion compliance across all functional views. This foundational approach avoids arbitrary delays and keeps the motion vocabulary unified.

## Overview

The dashboard relies on motion hooks from `dashboard/src/v2/lib/motion/`, including `useReducedMotionSafe` for accessibility-aware animations and `use-animated-active-indicator` for complex state transitions.

We export two sets of tokens to accommodate different styling approaches:

When components use standard interaction contracts, they dynamically apply durations and easings via inline `style` tags referencing `useInteractionTokens`.
- **`useInteractionTokens`** (from `tokens.ts`): Provides CSS transition durations (e.g., `"150ms"`) and CSS easings.
- **`INTERACTION_CSS_VARIABLES`** and **`buildInteractionTransition`** (from `tokens.ts`): Provide CSS custom-property based contracts such as `--interaction-control-feedback-duration` and a helper for composing transition strings without hardcoded timing.
- **`useGsapInteractionTokens`** (from `constants.ts`): Provides GSAP-compatible numeric durations (e.g., `0.15`) and string easings suitable for GSAP tweens.

## Interaction Contracts

Use the standard interaction definitions when designing animations:

1. **`controlFeedback`**
   - *Use Case:* Immediate responsive interactions on form controls, button overlays, icon feedback, select triggers, hover/focus/active states, toggle switches, and short message swaps inside an existing feedback surface.
   - *Pacing:* Fast.

2. **`enterExit`**
   - *Use Case:* Standard surfacing and removal of overlay elements, modals, dialogs, popovers, preview/browser window states, transport banners, and feedback containers.
   - *Pacing:* Base/Standard.

3. **`expansionCollapse`**
   - *Use Case:* Accordions, collapsible sections, drop-down menus revealing content inline.
   - *Pacing:* Base/Standard with smooth easing.

4. **`selectionMovement`**
   - *Use Case:* Animating active indicators, selected ledger rows, session cards, tab indicators, Stats mode details, and micro-movements where a selected item changes state without changing layout.
   - *Pacing:* Fast.

5. **`listReveal`**
   - *Use Case:* Staggered or simple unhiding of list items when content loads, filters expand, menus reveal grouped items, or a feed receives an initial batch.
   - *Pacing:* Base/Standard.

6. **`listReorder`**
   - *Use Case:* Repositioning items in sorted ledgers, toast stacks, task cards, drag surfaces, or virtualized windows after filtering, sorting, or removal.
   - *Pacing:* Fast.

7. **`inlineValidation`**
   - *Use Case:* Showing field-level validation errors, cancellation nudges, invalid submit cues, and bouncy validation recovery. To ensure accessible validation recovery on failed form submissions, automatically shift focus to the first invalid field.
   - *Pacing:* Fast with spring/bounce easing.

8. **`asyncFeedback`**
   - *Use Case:* Slower, deliberate reveal of asynchronous operation results, progress bars, toast entrance, `ActionFeedbackRegion`, planning progress, preview operation feedback, and live/runtime notifications.
   - *Pacing:* Slow and linear to ensure visibility.

## Implemented Surface Contracts

Current refined dashboard surfaces use the interaction contracts as follows:

| Surface | Motion contracts | State communication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared primitives (`Button`, `Select`, `DropdownMenu`, `ConfirmDialog`, `ActionFeedbackRegion`) | `controlFeedback`, `enterExit`, `expansionCollapse`, `inlineValidation`, `asyncFeedback` | Native `disabled` where possible; normalized `aria-disabled`; fixed feedback icon slots; `aria-busy` on pending controls or regions; status/alert live regions for async results. |
| Quicksprint panel | `enterExit`, `listReveal`, `selectionMovement`, `expansionCollapse`, `controlFeedback`, `asyncFeedback` | Browse, edit, and configure phases announce through a shared polite status region; picker controls expose expanded/selected state; planning suppresses duplicate requests; destructive template removal uses confirmation; cancel/status copy remains visible under reduced motion. |
| Sprint ledger | `controlFeedback`, `selectionMovement`, `listReorder`, `expansionCollapse`, `asyncFeedback` | Sort, filter, selection, and bulk-action changes are composed into one polite live-region message; selected and pending rows retain static badges; bulk delete uses `ConfirmDialog`; focus returns to the delete trigger or a ledger fallback after dialog teardown. |
| Sprint attention indicators | `asyncFeedback` | Failed gallery cells rely on the interactive workflow badge without a duplicate failure banner or outer alarm border. Human-owned gallery intervention uses a compact amber person/`zZZ` cue and labelled waiting status without a perimeter; compact ledger attention remains inline. Reduced motion removes optional pulse/bounce animation without removing status semantics. |
| Delivery workflow badge | `controlFeedback`, `enterExit`, `expansionCollapse`, `asyncFeedback` | One bright interactive badge exposes Coding → Pull request → QA → CI → Merge → Completion on Live, Tasks, Sprints, and Overview. A lightly translucent, blurred outer surface groups the opaque Delivery flow card, floating responsive arrow, and optional opaque QA card. Stage circles share the vertical center of their entries and anchor the dotted connector rail. Reduced motion keeps connectors and the arrow static. QA edits retain the blue pencil treatment; red identifies provider/runtime/workflow failure or explicit active human-only task attention as **Human needed**. Resolved, worker-actionable, and ambiguous sprint-run summaries fall back to the ordinary stage. |
| Notification center and execution toasts | `enterExit`, `listReveal`, `listReorder`, `asyncFeedback` | The panel combines cross-project execution attention, startup readiness, and selected-project scheduler notices. Execution rows keep project/sprint/task context, structured Details, and server-supplied route targets; only new or timestamp-updated global execution records create toasts after initial hydration. Warning toasts use the bottom-right stack, while system errors remain in the persistent assertive error stack. |
| Live runtime | `controlFeedback`, `enterExit`, `expansionCollapse`, `selectionMovement`, `listReveal`, `listReorder`, `asyncFeedback` | Reconnect, stale, refreshing, and recovering states keep the last runtime snapshot visible with polite live regions; disconnected transport and blocking errors are assertive; pending runtime actions remain focus-stable with `aria-disabled` plus activation suppression. Runtime force-complete and sprint pause/stop/delete controls require an explicit named confirmation before their side-effect handlers run. |
| Browser preview, file, and diff workbench | `controlFeedback`, `enterExit`, `selectionMovement`, `listReveal`, `listReorder`, `asyncFeedback` | Preview launch/rebuild/stop/navigation/script/log operations expose visible async status; unavailable links remain keyboard reachable as disabled link controls with persistent reasons; stale iframe/log content remains mounted during refresh when useful content exists. |
| Settings workspace | `controlFeedback`, `selectionMovement`, `enterExit`, `inlineValidation`, `asyncFeedback` | The unified opaque sticky command/status bar keeps scope selection, scope context, active panel, and right-aligned save/reset actions visible together; visible-category metadata appears only while Smart Find is active. Scope/category changes expose selected, pending, inherited, overridden, and disabled-reason text; saves use active-panel `aria-busy` plus `ActionFeedbackRegion`; provider removals use inline confirmation with cancel and focus restoration; fields preserve current draft values while loading or saving. |
| Global search | `enterExit`, `listReveal`, `controlFeedback`, `selectionMovement` | The input remains the combobox focus owner with `aria-activedescendant`; stale results remain available with `aria-busy`; unavailable rows expose a visible disabled reason and suppress pointer and keyboard activation; active rows are scrolled within the result container only. Running agent and preview-container dots use motion-safe animation only, with badge text, color, and static reduced-motion rings preserving status without pulse or ping motion. |
| Memory workspace | `controlFeedback`, `selectionMovement`, `listReveal`, `listReorder`, `expansionCollapse`, `inlineValidation`, `asyncFeedback` | Search/filter/selection changes announce counts and selected state; background refresh or failed refresh keeps the last useful list visible; batch delete uses confirmation, optimistic feedback, retry, and focus restoration; reduced motion keeps badges, rings, and live-region copy for selected graph/list state. |
| Task cards and active streams | `controlFeedback`, `selectionMovement`, `listReorder`, `asyncFeedback` | Status, dependency blockers, QA review, and PR/live metadata keep stable text equivalents; quick actions sit in the card footer and are visually revealed on hover or keyboard focus while remaining in the keyboard path with task-specific names. Low-value metadata such as the default `Auto` executor and pointer-only drag helper chip are omitted from visible card metadata, while screen-reader drag guidance, pending dispatch, `aria-busy`, disabled state, and reason text remain available. Task-board cards are keyed by stable card view-model identities so unrelated live events and filter announcements preserve mounted card controls instead of rerendering unchanged cards. Sprint selector running dots keep color, shadow, option labels, and selected/loading badges available when reduced motion disables pulse animation. |

## Cross-Surface Interaction Rules

- The delivery workflow badge replaces the standalone QA/CI disclosures wherever task or sprint delivery state is shown. Live also uses it instead of the separate task lifecycle badge; Tasks, Sprints, and Overview keep their surrounding lifecycle context.
- QA state inside the workflow must distinguish a completed requested-change verdict from a provider/runtime failure. Use the bright blue pencil-line **QA edits** treatment for `changes_requested`, the red-X **QA failed** treatment only for terminal provider/runtime failure, the green check for pass, and signal progress for running. Keep the latest persisted review visible independently of card lifecycle phase.
- The combined workflow/review surface is one hover, focus, activation, touch, and dismissal contract across Sprint, Task, Overview, and Live surfaces. Port it to the viewport, name both cards, preserve it while focus/pointer is within the trigger/card pair, dismiss outside mouse/touch and pointer departure without contained focus, and restore focus to the exact workflow or QA-chevron trigger that opened it on `Escape`.
- Follow-up task specifications must be collapsed on first render. Native disclosure buttons expose `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`; expansion reveals title, description, priority, dependency keys, and the full prompt in bounded overflow. Constrained layouts remain one-column, wider layouts may split summary/findings, and reduced motion snaps spinner, pulse, chevron, and transition changes while retaining all semantic and focus state.
- Workflow badges expose Coding, Pull request, QA, CI, Merge, and Completion with the first-class states `pending`, `in_progress`, `successful`, and `failed`; `in_progress` is displayed as running and `successful` uses the green-check treatment. Persisted CI evidence enriches the PR/CI/Merge stages but never controls whether the badge is mounted. Red X means a provider/runtime failure, failed check, merge conflict, or failed merge attempt; review-requested edits remain blue, a review blocker remains pending, and a merge conflict belongs to Merge.
- CI state comes from the newest persisted gate event per task/main-merge entity, tie-broken by event ID, plus active open/claimed CI-repair attention and durable merge fallback evidence. Project and Live snapshots rehydrate it across restart/reconnect. A newer recognized settled gate event or resolved/dismissed attention resolves stale failure for the same scoped entity.

- Preserve stale data when a surface already has a useful snapshot or list and the new request is a refresh, reconnect, retryable load failure, or transient stale state. Mark the affected region with `aria-busy` when it is actively updating, add polite status copy, and visually dim or badge the stale content without blocking valid actions.
- Realtime resources must keep websocket snapshots newer than REST refreshes. Direct websocket payloads advance the resource ordering clock before they are batched into the next animation frame, so an older REST response from polling, mount, or reconnect recovery cannot overwrite the newer snapshot when it finishes later.
- Treat `snapshot_required` as a recovery hint, not a reason to churn the UI. Repeated hints coalesce into one silent REST refresh, while an explicit foreground refresh, externally signaled refresh, or direct websocket payload supersedes the pending silent refresh before it can abort or overwrite newer work.
- Show an honest empty state when the committed query or filter set has no results. Do not keep stale content for a new committed search that legitimately returns no matches.
- Disabled or unavailable controls need a durable reason. Use visible helper text, a status badge, `aria-describedby`, or `title`; do not depend on click-time announcements from native disabled controls.
- Destructive dashboard actions use `useConfirmDialog` and `ConfirmDialog` when confirmation is required. The dialog must name the destructive target, trap focus, support Escape/cancel, expose pending progress when applicable, and restore focus to the initiating control or a safe page fallback.
- Focus restoration applies to overlays, menus, destructive confirmations, async feedback controls that remove themselves, and route-changing controls. Notification read actions keep focus on the row or control when it remains mounted so keyboard users can continue through the list. If the original trigger has disappeared or become unusable, move focus to a named route region, ledger/list fallback, `[data-focus-fallback]`, `[role="main"]`, or `body`.
- Notification destinations must use the server-supplied project-aware link. Preserve the real anchor `href`, and when routing in-app, pass its pathname and search parameters unchanged instead of rebuilding project, sprint, or task identifiers in the browser.
- Notification actions must dismiss every navbar-owned overlay before in-app routing begins. A Details action closes the details modal first, then TopNav closes the notification panel and restores focus to its trigger with focus-open suppression so the restored focus cannot reopen the panel over the destination route.
- Reduced motion is not reduced information. When token durations resolve to `0` or `"0ms"`, keep static state cues such as borders, rings, badges, count chips, progress text, `aria-busy`, disabled-reason copy, and live-region messages.
- Data interactions should announce the result of the operator action, not every visual frame. Sort changes, committed filters, selection counts, bulk-operation starts/completions, active search result changes, memory list changes, and runtime invocation-count summaries should use concise polite live-region text. Blocking errors and disconnected live transport remain assertive.
- Repeated async controls must include target-specific accessible names, suppress duplicate activation while pending, and keep stable icon/text slots so labels and hit targets do not jump when spinners or result icons appear.

## Accessibility & Async Feedback

When announcing asynchronous feedback (e.g., via Toasts, ActionFeedbackRegion, or NotificationPanel), motion is secondary to screen reader announcements.
- Ensure that the container uses proper ARIA attributes, typically `aria-live="polite"` or `aria-live="assertive"` with `aria-atomic="true"` so that the full context is announced when it appears.
- Visual movement (like a toast sliding in) must not interfere with the user's focus or block standard keyboard interaction.
- Use polite announcements for loading, empty, success, pending, background refresh, reconnect attempts that do not block the current view, and stale-data notices. Use assertive announcements only for blocking errors, failed saves, unavailable preview containers, disconnected live transport, and destructive confirmations that require immediate operator attention.
- `aria-busy` belongs on the control or region affected by async work. Keep stale content visible during background refresh whenever the source area already owns cached data, such as Stats, Tasks, Sprints, Overview telemetry, and Live runtime panels.
- `ActionFeedbackRegion` announces pending states politely, exposes pending progress with `aria-busy`, announces warning feedback politely, announces blocking errors assertively, and avoids repeated success announcements when a prior pending state already supplied context. Error feedback persists until dismissed or cleared; do not auto-dismiss a blocking error. Retry, dismiss, and clear-error controls keep stable slots, target-specific labels, focus fallback with `preventScroll`, and duplicate retry suppression while a retry is pending.
- Page-owned delayed feedback, such as Browser preview navigation confirmations, must store timeout ids and clear them during unmount cleanup so no delayed success announcement runs after the source surface is gone.
- Toasts use `asyncFeedback` for entrance, `enterExit` for dismissal, and `listReorder` when the non-error stack compacts. Non-error toast overflow may dismiss older items, but error toasts remain in the dedicated error stack until the user or caller removes them. Retry actions remain visible, expose `aria-busy` while pending, suppress duplicate activation, and do not dismiss a blocking error toast by themselves. If a retry, action, or dismiss removes the focused toast control, focus returns to a connected feedback/page fallback without scrolling the dashboard.
- Navbar execution toasts begin only after the global execution feed's first snapshot has hydrated. Seed source/version identities from that snapshot, then toast only a new source or a newer `updatedAt`; do not hydrate from startup or scheduler rows in the combined visible notification list. Toast actions mark the corresponding notification read and follow its supplied scoped route.
- Cancellation that the operator requested, such as sprint planning cancellation, is warning feedback rather than error feedback. Keep it visible until the operator dismisses it or starts another action.
- Stale-data and background-refresh states must preserve the last useful content when cached data exists. Use a polite status message, `aria-busy` on the updating region when applicable, and visible copy such as "Refreshing", "Updating", or "Stale Data" rather than replacing the surface with a spinner-only state.
- Pending actions must suppress duplicate activation and expose the blocked reason through visible status text, `title`, or `aria-describedby`. Do not rely on click-time announcements from disabled controls.
- Destructive confirmations must use a named dialog, focus trap, explicit confirm/cancel controls, and progress semantics for hold-to-confirm. Hold duration and cancellation feedback must use the shared interaction token system rather than arbitrary timers. Reduced motion may remove progress animation timing, but visible percent text, progressbar attributes, non-motion progress status text, and cancellation copy remain required; releasing, leaving, or cancelling the hold resets visual progress immediately when reduced motion is active.
- No critical action or state may be disclosed by hover alone. Hover-revealed affordances must also be reachable by keyboard focus, or the action must remain persistently visible.
- Dashboard reliability states should be covered with role-based regression tests: destructive confirmations assert dialog names, focus trapping, Escape/cancel behavior, pending `aria-busy`, and focus restoration; cache tests assert mutation invalidation and project/sprint scope isolation; reduced-motion tests assert zero-duration tokens while status DOM remains mounted; async route tests assert loading `status`, blocking `alert`, empty states, and stable action labels.

## Shared Control States

Shared dashboard controls use `SHARED_INTERACTION_CLASSES`, `useInteractionTokens`, and the dashboard focus ring variables for hover, focus-visible, active, disabled, pending, and selected feedback. Button-like controls suppress click handlers whenever native `disabled`, `aria-disabled`, or pending state is active, while loading controls expose `aria-busy` and keep static icons or colors visible when motion is reduced. Select triggers expose stable expanded, selected, disabled, and listbox relationship state through ARIA attributes.

Pending and success feedback must not resize controls. Shared buttons and icon buttons keep fixed feedback slots for spinners and status icons, and select triggers preserve their trigger dimensions while overlays animate independently with interaction tokens.

Disabled native buttons do not fire activation handlers. Disabled reasons therefore belong in visible status text, `aria-describedby`, `title`, or persistent badges, not only in click-time announcements.

## Reduced Motion

All interaction timings automatically respect the user's system preferences or dashboard settings for reduced motion (`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` or the dashboard-managed `html[data-reduced-motion]` attribute).

**How it works:**
- When a user prefers reduced motion, the aforementioned hooks (`useInteractionTokens`, `useGsapInteractionTokens`) automatically resolve all duration values to `0` or `"0ms"`.
- This ensures visual state changes happen instantly while preserving logical flows and React/Preact lifecycle events that depend on state transitions.
- The root CSS guard also treats explicit app settings (`data-reduced-motion="true"` and the legacy preview value `"REDUCE"`) like the OS media query, so Tailwind animation utilities such as spin, pulse, ping, bounce, and skeleton shimmer collapse to static states outside hook-driven components.
- Do not hardcode custom fallback logic for `duration`. Use the hooks, and the components will naturally skip the animation timing.
- Decorative or continuous animations (e.g., GSAP, SVG `<animate>`, Tailwind flow) must be explicitly disabled. State-communicating animations must be replaced with static visual equivalents (like badges or colored shadows) rather than simply being removed, to preserve state comprehension.
- Shared visual primitives use tokenized static cues in reduced motion: status dots retain semantic halos, active wave fills remain visible without drifting, sparklines render as static lines, and live duration flashes use an instant inset Signal Jade highlight.
- `SprintAttentionIndicator` keeps its red cell/row boundary and labelled failure or waiting state when reduced motion removes the failure pulse and human-waiting bounce. Notification rows and toasts likewise keep severity, context, read state, and actions while reveal/reorder transitions snap to their final state.
- Browser rails, task cards, Stats charts, telemetry feeds, and shell navigation may still change state under reduced motion, but they must snap to the new state and keep visible static cues for selection, focus, warning, progress, and connection state.
- Avoid animation-only communication. Every spinner, pulse, drag movement, chart transition, progress change, or status flash must have a static text, badge, color, outline, `aria-busy`, live-region, or label equivalent that remains available when reduced motion resolves durations to `0` or `0ms`.

## Overlay Transitions & Focus Management

All standard overlays (Dialog, DropdownMenu, Popover, Tooltip, ConfirmDialog) adhere to specific rules for transitions and accessibility:

1. **Transitions:** Overlays must use the `enterExit` or `controlFeedback` tokens (via `useInteractionTokens()` or `useGsapInteractionTokens()`) rather than hardcoded durations (e.g., `150ms`). These hooks ensure that `prefers-reduced-motion` settings automatically disable CSS transitions or set GSAP durations to 0.
2. **Focus Restoration:** Dialogs, DropdownMenus, and Popovers must reliably restore focus to the element that triggered them when they close through Escape, outside click, cancel/action buttons, or controlled state changes. Close handlers cache the `document.activeElement` during the `isOpen` state change and restore with `.focus({ preventScroll: true })` so fixed dashboard chrome does not jump.
3. **Safe Fallback Focus:** If the original trigger is removed, disabled, hidden, inert, or otherwise unusable when an overlay closes, focus must move to a safe page fallback such as `[data-overlay-focus-fallback]`, `[data-focus-fallback]`, `main`, `[role="main"]`, `#root`, or finally `document.body`. Fallback targets may receive `tabindex="-1"` programmatically so keyboard users are not left with focus on a removed overlay node.
4. **Menu Keyboard Navigation:** Dropdown menus and lists utilizing arrow key navigation should use standard roles (e.g., `role="menuitem"`) and ensure their querying logic explicitly ignores `disabled` or `aria-disabled="true"` elements to ensure users do not become trapped on non-interactive items. `Home` and `End` move to the first and last enabled item; Escape must prevent default key handling, close the overlay, and restore focus without page scroll jumps.
5. **Focus Trapping:** Active focus traps must gracefully handle empty containers or containers with dynamically hidden content. If no valid focusable descendants exist, the container itself receives focus. Traps must filter out hidden, disabled, inert, or `aria-hidden="true"` elements when calculating focus boundaries.
6. **Scroll Management:** When native `element.scrollIntoView()` triggers unwanted whole-page layout shifts or window bouncing in nested `overflow-y-auto` panels, replace it by calculating bounding client rects (`element.getBoundingClientRect()`) against the container and adjusting `container.scrollTop` manually.

Global search follows the same overlay rules. Its open/close GSAP timeline uses `enterExit`, `listReveal`, and `controlFeedback` interaction tokens; the result list keeps stale matches visible during background refresh with `aria-busy`, a polite live status, and visual dimming. Arrow-key navigation updates the combobox `aria-activedescendant`, skips unavailable rows when an activatable option exists, and keeps the active row visible by adjusting the overlay result scroller, not the page scroll position. If every result is disabled or unavailable, navigation keeps a deterministic inactive row referenced so the combobox never points at `-1`, while Enter remains non-activating. Disabled or unavailable rows stay visible with a persistent reason badge, `aria-disabled`, and activation suppression for pointer and keyboard selection.

## Menu & Popover Keyboard Expectations
DropdownMenus and Popovers are expected to be fully keyboard accessible:
- Triggers cloned into these components preserve caller's `ref`, `onClick`, `onKeyDown`, `aria-label`, and disabled behavior while augmenting `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-controls`.
- Menus open via `Enter`, `Space`, `ArrowDown`, or `ArrowUp`. Opening via `ArrowDown`, `Enter`, or `Space` focuses the first item, while `ArrowUp` focuses the last item.
- Arrow navigation inside the menu works in a looping fashion (ArrowDown goes down, ArrowUp goes up) and skips disabled items. `Home` and `End` keys jump to the first and last enabled items respectively.
- Popovers that act as dialogs trap focus inside themselves. Popovers acting as tooltips do not trap focus. Both close on `Escape` and restore focus to their trigger.

## Shell, Selector, And Workbench Controls

- Top-nav project and sprint selectors, the Tasks page sprint scope selector, Browser session controls, and file/change selectors use listbox-style keyboard behavior: trigger opens with `Enter`, `Space`, `ArrowDown`, or `ArrowUp`; options move with arrows; `Home`/`End` jump; `Escape` closes and restores focus.
- Tabbed workspaces such as Stats ledgers and Git telemetry leaderboards use `tablist` semantics with arrow-key movement and `tabpanel` relationships. Pressed button groups such as Stats visual modes may use `aria-pressed` when the behavior is a command-style view toggle rather than a tab panel.
- Dialog and destructive confirmation flows must keep focus trapped while open, expose a stable accessible name, and restore focus after close. Hold-to-confirm progress should be described with stable `aria-describedby` text instead of noisy live updates; cancellation, completion, and loading states should be visible on the control itself for pointer and keyboard users.
- Settings reset, task rerun/reset, task force-complete, and sprint pause/stop/delete flows must resolve confirmation promises through the explicit dialog choice. Cancel, Escape, and backdrop dismissal resolve false and must not call the destructive or restart side-effect handler.
- Route changes triggered by shell links, task links, Browser controls, or sprint/task selectors must leave the destination with a named page landmark. If focus is programmatically moved, use `preventScroll` where possible to avoid jumping fixed shell chrome.
- Keyboard-only users must be able to operate Browser chrome, session rail actions, settings forms, task/sprint selectors, stats filters, command menus, and compact mobile controls without hover-only disclosure.
- Task cards and active stream rows keep status, dependency blockers, QA review state, PR/live duration metadata, drag limitations, and action availability available without relying on pointer hover. Pointer drag remains pointer-only; its visual helper chip is no longer card metadata, but screen-reader drag guidance remains available. Reduced-motion users receive static drag-disabled messaging instead of keyboard drag-and-drop.
- Kanban task cards keep one persistent, task-labelled Actions trigger in the metadata footer instead of an expanded action rail. The shared portal-backed menu groups execution/navigation actions, Edit, and destructive Delete; it supports standard trigger keys, looping arrow traversal, Home/End, Escape, outside dismissal, trigger focus restoration, and pointer-event isolation from card drag. Unavailable and optimistic actions remain visible as inert menu items with exact row-level reasons and `aria-describedby`, while safe internal/external links keep their destination and protection attributes. Dependency summaries retain blocker counts, and each list row visibly shows only the task identifier plus normalized resolved, blocked, in-progress, ready-for-QA, QA-failed, or unknown status; full titles and blocker context remain accessible. Task cards expose `PR pending` only when task PR creation is enabled by effective project git settings, while real PR-ready links remain visible whenever a historical or runtime-enriched PR URL exists. Live runtime, QA review, optimistic saving, focus, pressed, dragging, and reduced-motion states remain available through static text, borders, badges, and accessible labels.

## Verification Guidance
- `pnpm run typecheck:dashboard`

For documentation-only changes to dashboard interaction guidance, run the dashboard typecheck and verify entrypoint links and anchors:

```bash
pnpm run typecheck:dashboard
rg "Interaction Patterns|Shared Primitive Design System|Dashboard Interaction Contracts" docs/index.md docs/SUMMARY.md
rg "stale data|disabled|ConfirmDialog|reduced motion|aria-busy|asyncFeedback" docs/dashboard/interaction-patterns.md docs/dashboard/design-system-shared-primitives.md docs/dashboard/dashboard-guide.md
```

For dashboard UI changes, run focused component tests for the touched surface first, then the repository dashboard suite and dashboard typecheck:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run <focused dashboard test files>
pnpm run test:dashboard
pnpm run typecheck:dashboard
```

Run `pnpm run build` when changes touch shared contracts, routing, CSS token boundaries, imports, or production bundling behavior. Do not record a check as passed unless it was run for the current change.
