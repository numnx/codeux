# Interaction Patterns

The dashboard UI uses a set of shared interaction tokens to ensure standard easing, timing, and reduced-motion compliance across all functional views. This foundational approach avoids arbitrary delays and keeps the motion vocabulary unified.

## Overview

We export two sets of tokens to accommodate different styling approaches:

When components use standard interaction contracts, they dynamically apply durations and easings via inline `style` tags referencing `useInteractionTokens`.
- **`useInteractionTokens`** (from `tokens.ts`): Provides CSS transition durations (e.g., `"150ms"`) and CSS easings.
- **`useGsapInteractionTokens`** (from `constants.ts`): Provides GSAP-compatible numeric durations (e.g., `0.15`) and string easings suitable for GSAP tweens.

## Interaction Contracts

Use the standard interaction definitions when designing animations:

1. **`controlFeedback`**
   - *Use Case:* Immediate responsive interactions on form controls (e.g., hover/focus states, active scale, toggle switches).
   - *Pacing:* Fast.

2. **`enterExit`**
   - *Use Case:* Standard surfacing of overlay elements, modals, dialogs, and large popovers.
   - *Pacing:* Base/Standard.

3. **`expansionCollapse`**
   - *Use Case:* Accordions, collapsible sections, drop-down menus revealing content inline.
   - *Pacing:* Base/Standard with smooth easing.

4. **`selectionMovement`**
   - *Use Case:* Animating active indicators (like moving an active tab background) or micro-movements of selected items.
   - *Pacing:* Fast.

5. **`listReveal`**
   - *Use Case:* Staggered or simple unhiding of list items when a group of content loads or expands.
   - *Pacing:* Base/Standard.

6. **`listReorder`**
   - *Use Case:* Fluidly animating the repositioning of items in a drag-and-drop list or sorted table.
   - *Pacing:* Fast.

7. **`inlineValidation`**
   - *Use Case:* Showing field-level validation errors, shake animations, or bouncy cues for invalid inputs.
   - *Pacing:* Fast with spring/bounce easing.

8. **`asyncFeedback`**
   - *Use Case:* Slower, deliberate reveal of asynchronous operation results (e.g., Toast notifications, `ActionFeedbackRegion`, `NotificationPanel`).
   - *Pacing:* Slow and linear to ensure visibility.

## Accessibility & Async Feedback

When announcing asynchronous feedback (e.g., via Toasts, ActionFeedbackRegion, or NotificationPanel), motion is secondary to screen reader announcements.
- Ensure that the container uses proper ARIA attributes, typically `aria-live="polite"` or `aria-live="assertive"` with `aria-atomic="true"` so that the full context is announced when it appears.
- Visual movement (like a toast sliding in) must not interfere with the user's focus or block standard keyboard interaction.

## Reduced Motion

All interaction timings automatically respect the user's system preferences or dashboard settings for reduced motion (`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`).

**How it works:**
- When a user prefers reduced motion, the aforementioned hooks (`useInteractionTokens`, `useGsapInteractionTokens`) automatically resolve all duration values to `0` or `"0ms"`.
- This ensures visual state changes happen instantly while preserving logical flows and React/Preact lifecycle events that depend on state transitions.
- Do not hardcode custom fallback logic for `duration`. Use the hooks, and the components will naturally skip the animation timing.

### Decorative vs State-Communicating Motion
- **Decorative Motion:** Continuous or ambient movement (like particle effects, flowing lines, swaying ships) must be completely disabled when `prefers-reduced-motion` is true.
- **State-Communicating Motion:** If an animation is the primary indicator of state (e.g. an animated pulsing dot for "live" or a shake for "error"), replacing the animation with a static visual equivalent is required so that comprehension is not lost. Use explicit non-animated static elements (like colored shadows, badges, or text) to convey the same meaning.

## Overlay Transitions & Focus Management

All standard overlays (Dialog, DropdownMenu, Popover, Tooltip, ConfirmDialog) adhere to specific rules for transitions and accessibility:

1. **Transitions:** Overlays must use the `enterExit` or `controlFeedback` tokens (via `useInteractionTokens()` or `useGsapInteractionTokens()`) rather than hardcoded durations (e.g., `150ms`). These hooks ensure that `prefers-reduced-motion` settings automatically disable CSS transitions or set GSAP durations to 0.
2. **Focus Restoration:** Dialogs, DropdownMenus, and Popovers must reliably restore focus to the element that triggered them when they close. This relies on caching the `document.activeElement` during the `isOpen` state change and using `.focus({ preventScroll: true })` after closing to prevent unexpected page jumps.
3. **Menu Keyboard Navigation:** Dropdown menus and lists utilizing arrow key navigation should use standard roles (e.g., `role="menuitem"`) and ensure their querying logic explicitly ignores `disabled` or `aria-disabled="true"` elements to ensure users do not become trapped on non-interactive items.
4. **Focus Trapping:** Active focus traps must gracefully handle empty containers or containers with dynamically hidden content. If no valid focusable descendants exist, the container itself receives focus. Traps must filter out hidden, disabled, inert, or `aria-hidden="true"` elements when calculating focus boundaries. Furthermore, if the original trigger is removed from the DOM, focus safely falls back to the document body.

## Menu & Popover Keyboard Expectations
DropdownMenus and Popovers are expected to be fully keyboard accessible:
- Triggers cloned into these components preserve caller's `ref`, `onClick`, `onKeyDown`, `aria-label`, and disabled behavior while augmenting `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-controls`.
- Menus open via `Enter`, `Space`, `ArrowDown`, or `ArrowUp`. Opening via `ArrowDown`, `Enter`, or `Space` focuses the first item, while `ArrowUp` focuses the last item.
- Arrow navigation inside the menu works in a looping fashion (ArrowDown goes down, ArrowUp goes up) and skips disabled items. `Home` and `End` keys jump to the first and last enabled items respectively.
- Popovers that act as dialogs trap focus inside themselves. Popovers acting as tooltips do not trap focus. Both close on `Escape` and restore focus to their trigger.
