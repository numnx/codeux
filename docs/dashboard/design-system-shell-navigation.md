# Design System: Shell Navigation

This document defines the rules and standardized styling for the dashboard shell chrome (Sidebar and Top Navigation) to maintain a cohesive, premium, and unified interface.

## Core Visual Attributes

### 1. Glass Surfaces
Shell elements utilize glassmorphism to blend with the underlying dashboard space softly, preserving a sense of depth without distraction.

- **Standard Backdrop:** `bg-[#F9F8F4]/80 dark:bg-void-900/80 backdrop-blur-xl`
- **Dropdown Overlays:** `bg-white/95 dark:bg-void-800/95 backdrop-blur-2xl`
- **Border Treatment:** A unified exact delicate border is maintained across shell containers using `border-black/[0.06] dark:border-white/[0.06]`. For overlays, use `border-black/[0.08] dark:border-white/[0.08]`.

### 2. Compact Control Height
Header dropdowns, searches, and related shell controls are standardized to a single compact height to ensure clean horizontal alignment.

- **Height Utility:** Use `h-9` or `min-h-[40px]`.
- **Vertical Padding:** Avoid aggressive internal vertical padding inside flex items; rely on the fixed height `h-9` + `items-center` for perfect centering.
- **Header Container Container:** The primary nav container uses `min-h-[60px]` instead of fixed `h-[60px]` to allow clustering elements to wrap on constrained viewports if needed.

### 3. Unified Focus Rings
All interactive components inside the shell layer must follow exactly the same focus rules.

- **Class Rule:** `focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-signal-500/50`
- **Application:** Applies universally to top-nav dropdowns, global search inputs, sidebar navigation links, tooltips, and notification buttons.

### 4. Responsiveness and Truncation
Stable layouts on narrow widths (especially mobile or multi-panel layouts) must maintain access to controls without triggering horizontal overflow.

- **Wrapping:** Top-level header layouts should use `flex-wrap md:flex-nowrap` to gracefully wrap clusters on very small viewports instead of hiding them or clipping.
- **Project & Sprint Menus:** Must remain visible on compact screens. Enforce strict text truncation using `truncate` and responsive maximum widths (e.g., `max-w-[80px] sm:max-w-[140px] md:max-w-[200px]`) rather than letting content dictate unbounded flex-growth.
- **Search and Telemetry Layout:** Components should gracefully hide text or collapse altogether (e.g. icon-only triggers) instead of overflowing the flex container.

### 5. Hover and Active Indicators
- **Interactions:** Hover backgrounds for triggers follow `hover:bg-black/[0.05] dark:hover:bg-white/[0.05]`. Active routes in the Sidebar use the primary `signal-500` marker tone.
- **Tooltips:** Minimized sidebar items expose semantic `aria-label`s on their links and keep visual tooltips explicitly mapped via `aria-hidden="true"` styled to mimic standard dropdown glass panels (`shadow-2xl rounded-2xl`).

### 6. Selector Keyboard Navigation (Combobox/Listbox)
Project and Sprint dropdowns follow a strict, accessible keyboard contract:
- **Triggers:** Button triggers manage `aria-expanded` and open the dropdown on Space, Enter, or ArrowDown.
- **Filter Inputs:** Inputs inside the dropdown have `role="combobox"`, `aria-autocomplete="list"`, and announce result counts dynamically using `aria-describedby` screen reader spans (e.g., "5 projects found. Use arrow keys to navigate.").
- **Navigation:** Once open, focus is managed such that the user can freely use the `ArrowDown` and `ArrowUp` keys to traverse the `button` options and `input` safely. Arrow keys explicitly skip options that are `disabled` or have `aria-disabled="true"`.
- **Dismissal & Recovery:** Pressing `Escape` or selecting an option cleanly closes the dropdown and reliably returns focus to the origin trigger button to maintain context.
