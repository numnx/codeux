# Styleguides and Tech Stacks

Code UX has two related dashboard concepts for project guidance:

- **Techstacks** classify the project implementation stack and application kind. They are managed in Settings -> Techstacks.
- **Guidance** selects reusable worker instructions for tech-stack expectations and visual styleguide direction. It is managed in Settings -> Guidance and mirrored in the top navigation.

This page focuses on the Guidance workflow. See [Configuration and Storage](../settings/configuration-and-storage.md) for persistence details and [Techstacks](../settings/techstacks.md) for the project classification catalog.

## Guidance Catalogs

Guidance uses two catalogs:

- **Tech Stack Guidance** entries describe implementation expectations such as framework, typing, module boundaries, and testing posture.
- **Styleguide** entries describe product design, layout, interaction, accessibility, and visual quality expectations.

Both catalogs include protected built-in entries plus custom entries. Every entry has a stable `id`, `name`, `summary`, and `instructionMarkdown`. Built-in entries can be selected but not edited or deleted. Custom entries can be added, edited, deleted, and selected from the same controls.

Both selectors include the stable `none` entry. Selecting `None` persists `none` and tells prompt builders to omit extra guidance for that catalog. This keeps repository instructions and the task prompt as the only guidance source when a project does not need a reusable tech-stack or styleguide instruction set.

## Dashboard Workflow

The top navigation shows the active project's effective tech-stack guidance and styleguide selectors beside global search. The selectors are disabled until a project is selected and effective settings are loaded.

Selecting an entry in either header dropdown saves a project-level `designGuidance` override immediately. Choosing `None` saves the stable `none` id. Each dropdown also has footer actions:

- **Add Tech Stack** opens Settings -> Guidance at `/config?category=guidance#guidance` so a custom tech-stack guidance entry can be added.
- **Add Styleguide** opens the same Guidance settings area for a custom styleguide entry.
- **Manage Guidance** opens the Guidance settings area for reviewing selections, visibility, and custom entries.

The Settings -> Guidance page edits the active settings scope. System scope updates the inheritable default guidance, project scope updates the active project override, and sprint overrides participate in effective resolution when present. The effective value is what the header selectors display and what planning/setup prompts use.

## Hiding Default Styleguides

`hideDefaultStyleguides` hides built-in styleguides from dashboard selectors while preserving `None` and custom styleguides. It does not delete built-in catalog entries and does not clear the saved selection.

If a hidden built-in styleguide is already selected, the settings panel preserves the selected id and warns that the active default is hidden. Choose `None`, select a custom styleguide, or turn defaults back on to change the selection from the visible selector.

Tech-stack guidance defaults are not hidden by this control.

## Project Defaults

The base `designGuidance` defaults are:

- `selectedTechStackId: "none"`
- `selectedStyleguideId: "none"`
- `hideDefaultStyleguides: false`
- no custom entries

Existing projects and imported local or Git projects inherit `none` unless an operator, setup flow, or sprint override changes them.

New local and new remote project creation seeds an explicit project override for the generic Code UX styleguide, `code-ux-award-winning`. It does not automatically select tech-stack guidance unless the creation flow provides one. Caller-provided guidance overrides are preserved, with only a missing styleguide selection filled by the Code UX styleguide seed.

## Prompt Effects

Planning and Project Setup resolve the effective project settings before building prompts. Selected non-`none` tech-stack and styleguide entries are added as a compact `Project Guidance` section. `None` selections do not inject catalog entry instructions, so imported projects do not receive Code UX styleguide instructions by default.

When the styleguide remains `none`, Project Setup still asks the setup agent to inspect the repository's existing styling, brand assets, design tokens, components, layouts, and interaction patterns before proposing a project-specific styleguide. This setup-only discovery notice is included even when tech-stack guidance is also `none`; Planning prompts continue to omit inactive `none` selections entirely.
