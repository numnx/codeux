# Dashboard Guide

The dashboard provides real-time visibility and runtime controls for orchestration.

## Access

Default URL:
- `http://localhost:4444`

Configured by:
- dashboard settings (`dashboardPort`)
- `.env` (`DASHBOARD_PORT`)
- `config.json` (`dashboardPort` / `DASHBOARD_PORT` / `dashboard.port`)
- fallback default `4444`

If the requested port is busy, startup automatically retries the next port (`+1`) until it finds a free port.

## API Endpoints Used by Dashboard

Implemented in `src/server/dashboard-server.ts`.

Project management:
- `GET /api/projects`
  - Lists projects plus selected project id and aggregate counts
- `POST /api/projects`
  - Creates a project (`local` or `git`)
- `PATCH /api/projects/:projectId`
  - Updates project metadata
- `DELETE /api/projects/:projectId`
  - Deletes a project and cascades its sprints/tasks
- `PUT /api/projects/:projectId/select`
  - Persists the active dashboard project
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/sprints`
  - Lists sprints for the selected project
- `POST /api/projects/:projectId/sprints`
  - Creates a sprint
- `POST /api/projects/:projectId/sprints/import`
  - Imports sprint/task markdown into sqlite
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/sprints/:sprintId/export`
  - Exports one sprint plus its tasks back to markdown
- `PATCH /api/sprints/:sprintId`
  - Updates sprint metadata
- `DELETE /api/sprints/:sprintId`
  - Deletes a sprint and cascades its tasks
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/tasks`
  - Lists tasks for a project, optionally filtered by `sprintId`
- `POST /api/projects/:projectId/tasks`
  - Creates a task
- `PATCH /api/tasks/:taskId`
  - Updates task metadata and dependency ids
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:taskId`
  - Deletes a task
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/connections`
  - Lists MCP connections visible to the selected project
- `PATCH /api/connections/:connectionId`
  - Updates connection metadata such as role/status/instruction payload
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/conversations/threads`
  - Lists project conversation threads
- `POST /api/projects/:projectId/conversations/threads`
  - Creates a new project conversation thread
- `GET /api/conversations/threads/:threadId/messages`
  - Lists stored messages for one thread
- `POST /api/projects/:projectId/conversations/messages`
  - Stores a dashboard-authored message and queues it for a listener

Legacy runtime:
- `GET /api/status`
  - Selected-project runtime payload (`sprint_number`, `subtasks`, `instructions`, etc.) projected from sqlite
- `GET /api/live-activities`
  - Session activity stream for running tasks in the selected project
- `GET /api/settings`
  - Persisted dashboard settings
- `PUT /api/settings`
  - Save settings
- `GET /api/settings/import-sources`
  - External key hints from env/json
- `GET /api/git-status`
  - Git branch, PR, CI, merge history, warnings
- `POST /api/tasks/:taskId/rerun`
  - Resets a selected-project runtime task and immediately starts a fresh provider session for that task

## UI Sections

### V2 project management
- Top-nav project selector persists the active project in sqlite
- Projects page is DB-backed and can create/select/delete projects
- Sprints page is project-scoped, creates sprint records in sqlite, and exposes markdown import/export controls
- Tasks page is project-scoped and supports create/edit/delete plus dependency metadata
- Overview widgets and headline stat cards now read project/task data from the same project-management API surface
- Agents page is DB-backed and lists registered MCP connections for the selected project
- Chat page is DB-backed and stores project conversation threads/messages in sqlite

### Dashboard view
- Task statistics
- Task pipeline cards
- Task cards include a `Rerun` action with confirmation prompt; rerun clears session/PR/merge state for that task and starts it again
- Live activity sidebar
- Protocol instruction panel
- Git/CI status panel

Runtime scoping:
- the selected project in the v2 top navigation now also scopes live session status, reruns, live activities, and git tracking
- the selected project also scopes Agents and Chat data
- dashboard runtime state is projected through sqlite task-run records instead of being served only from one in-memory global payload

### Settings view
- Basic settings
  - includes `Dashboard Port` field
- AI provider settings
- Git settings
- CI Intelligence settings
- Sprint loop step toggles
- MCP tool toggles
- Skill toggles

## Polling Behavior

From `dashboard/src/hooks/use-dashboard-runtime-data.ts`:
- Status and live activities poll every 10 seconds.
- Git status polls every 10 seconds.

Settings are loaded from `dashboard/src/hooks/use-dashboard-settings.ts` and saved through
`dashboard/src/lib/api/dashboard-api.ts` request helpers.

Project management requests are centralized in:
- `dashboard/src/v2/lib/project-api.ts`
- `dashboard/src/v2/context/project-data.tsx`
- `dashboard/src/v2/lib/connection-api.ts`

## Multi-Provider Settings

AI Provider settings now support:
- Providers: `jules`, `gemini`, `codex`
- Routing strategy:
  - `MANUAL` (single default provider)
  - `WEIGHTED` (weight-based distribution)
  - `ORCHESTRATOR` (rule-based routing with weighted fallback)
- Provider toggles (`enabled`)
- Model selection
  - Gemini: curated model list in UI
  - Codex/Jules: text model field
- Thinking mode (`SMALL`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`)
- Optional per-provider API key fields

Behavior:
- Empty provider key fields are valid.
- Runtime falls back to system auth/environment where supported.

## CI Intelligence Settings

Settings group:
- `enabled`
- `enableLivePrMonitoring`
- `waitForCiBeforeMainMerge`
- `resolveAllCommentsBeforeMainMerge`
- `waitForCiBeforeFeatureMerge`
- `resolveAllCommentsBeforeFeatureMerge`
- `waitForJulesCiAutofix`
- `julesCiAutofixMaxRetries`
- `featurePrAutoMergeMode` (`OFF|WHEN_GREEN|ALWAYS`)

Effect:
- These settings influence protocol text generated by orchestrator.
- When `waitForCiBeforeFeatureMerge` is enabled (REMOTE mode), merge readiness is now gated by real feature-PR checks (not instruction text only).
- `enableLivePrMonitoring` can disable live PR/CI polling gates entirely; in `LOCAL` git mode it is forced off.
- `waitForJulesCiAutofix` controls feedback mode while blocked:
  - enabled: explicit autofix-wait guidance for failed checks.
  - disabled: merge-gate guidance without autofix wording.
- `julesCiAutofixMaxRetries` sets how many Jules autofix notifications are attempted before escalation. Escalation output includes exact task ids, PR links, failed check names, failed run summaries, and failed job names so no manual searching is needed.
- `featurePrAutoMergeMode = WHEN_GREEN` executes feature-PR auto-merge once checks are green and review blockers are clear.
- `featurePrAutoMergeMode = ALWAYS` attempts feature-PR auto-merge regardless of CI state (subject to repository merge protections).
- Feature-PR CI wait/automerge matching uses worker branch first and falls back to the task `pr_url`, so tasks without a stored worker branch still remain gated correctly.
- CI Runs in `Feature PR CI` tracking include recent runs from PR head branches targeting the feature implementation branch (plus feature branch runs), sorted newest-first; the panel shows the latest 5.
- Failed CI runs in tracking are enriched with failed job details and failed-job log excerpts (bounded) from GitHub Actions `gh run view` data.
- Main merge stage (`feature -> main`) now emits live CI/review gate feedback with failed check names and ready-to-run `gh` commands.
- Main merge into default branch still stays manual.

## Sprint Loop Step Toggles

Each step can be independently enabled or disabled in settings:
- Branch preflight
- Planning preflight
- Load subtasks
- Session sync
- Status derivation
- Start ready tasks
- Merge protocol
- Action-required protocol
- Status table
- Watch loop

Use case:
- Controlled rollout, debugging, experimentation, or operational recovery.

## Git Status Panel Notes

`src/services/git-status-service.ts` behavior:
- Git/CI tracking uses the active sprint repository path (`repo_path`) from the latest sprint status update, not the MCP server repository root.
- In `LOCAL` mode, PR/CI tracking is disabled.
- In `REMOTE` mode, requires `gh` and auth.
- Warnings include common conflict/CI trigger issues.
- Tracking scope is dynamic and shown in panel metadata:
  - `Feature PR CI` while sprint tasks are actively running and feature CI wait gate is enabled.
  - `Main Branch CI` outside active running-task windows (including final merge stage).
- PR comment counters are sourced from GitHub `comments` payloads in both object and numeric shapes.
- Recent merges list includes all fetched merges into feature-prefixed branches and the default branch.

## No-Key Startup Mode

Server startup no longer exits when Jules API key is missing.

Behavior:
- MCP server and dashboard still start.
- API-backed tools return setup guidance until key is configured.
- Guidance points to:
  - `.env` (`JULES_API_KEY`)
  - `.jules-subagents/settings.json` (`julesApiKey`)
  - Dashboard settings (`http://localhost:4444` by default)

Runtime update:
- Saving a key in dashboard settings updates runtime API usage without restart.
- Leaving the dashboard key empty is supported; system-wide environment keys are used when present.

## Session Tracking and Live Feed

For Gemini/Codex runs, sessions are tracked locally and surfaced with the same dashboard flow:
- Session IDs and states appear in task cards.
- Live activity feed displays streamed CLI output.
- PR URL is shown once the workflow creates the PR.

## Security Notes

- API keys are masked in UI inputs.
- Settings persistence is local sqlite, not a cloud backend.
- Token priority for git status:
  - UI token first
  - then external hint fallback
- Markdown rendering now strips raw inline HTML before inserting into the DOM, reducing script injection risk from activity/prompt content.

## Frontend Architecture Notes

- `dashboard/src/app.tsx` now focuses on view composition only.
- Runtime status polling, live activity merge, and stat derivation are encapsulated in `use-dashboard-runtime-data`.
- Settings load/save/import flows are encapsulated in `use-dashboard-settings`.
- HTTP calls are centralized in `dashboard/src/lib/api/dashboard-api.ts` for consistent error handling and easier testability.
- V2 project CRUD and selected-project state are centralized in `dashboard/src/v2/lib/project-api.ts` and `dashboard/src/v2/context/project-data.tsx`.
- `dashboard/src/components/SettingsPage.tsx` now acts as a container and delegates each settings domain to focused section components under `dashboard/src/components/settings/`.
- Shared settings UI primitives now live in `dashboard/src/components/settings/primitives.tsx` (`SettingsCard`, `ToggleRow`, `FieldLabel`) to reduce duplicate form markup and keep section components consistent.
- `dashboard/src/components/ui/` now contains focused presentation subcomponents for large cards/sections:
  - `ui/task-card/` hosts `TaskHeader`, `SessionFeed`, `TaskMetadata`, and `StatusBadge`.
  - `ui/settings/` hosts `StrategySelector`, `ProviderConfigRow`, `ExecutionModeSelector`, and `DockerCredentialsSection`.
- Immutable settings state updates are centralized in `dashboard/src/lib/settings-updaters.ts`; settings sections consume these typed helpers instead of manually reconstructing nested objects.
- Task cards use button semantics and ARIA expansion state for title/details/log toggles.
