# Design System: Feedback & Overlays

## Core Principles

The Code UX dashboard relies on transient overlays (modals, dialogs, drawers, popovers) and feedback mechanisms (toasts, action feedback regions) to communicate state changes without losing context.
These components map to current Preact implementations in `dashboard/src/v2/components/ui/`, such as `Modal`, `Dialog`, `ConfirmDialog`, and `ActionFeedbackRegion`.

These surfaces share unified styling rules to ensure the dashboard feels cohesive, grounded, and consistent in both light and dark modes.

## Surfaces & Elevations

All floating surfaces in the application share a single elevated visual language.

### Standard Surface (Modals, Dialogs, Drawers, Skeletons from `dashboard/src/v2/components/ui/`)
Used for primary overlay surfaces that sit above the rest of the page layout.

- **Background:** `bg-white dark:bg-void-800`
- **Radius:** `rounded-2xl`
- **Border:** `border border-black/[0.08] dark:border-white/[0.08]`
- **Shadow:** `shadow-2xl`
- **Scrolling Behavior:** For modals requiring independent scrolling of body content (like long forms), override the `Modal` default overflow by adding `!overflow-hidden flex flex-col` to its `className`. Structure the inner modal with fixed headers/footers using `shrink-0` and make the content body scrollable with `flex-1 overflow-y-auto min-h-0`. In dialog or modal footers, use `flex flex-col-reverse sm:flex-row items-stretch sm:items-center` to stack action buttons vertically on mobile.

### Floating Popups (Popovers, Menus, DropdownMenus from `dashboard/src/v2/components/ui/`)
Used for transient contextual interfaces anchored to a trigger.

- **Background:** `bg-white dark:bg-void-800`
- **Radius:** `rounded-2xl`
- **Border:** `border border-black/[0.08] dark:border-white/[0.08]`
- **Shadow:** `shadow-[0_16px_36px_rgba(15,23,42,0.14)] dark:shadow-[0_16px_36px_rgba(0,0,0,0.4)]`
- **Mobile Viewport Clamping:** Fixed and absolute positioned menus (like action dropdowns or import surfaces) must use viewport clamping (e.g., `max-w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]`) to prevent horizontal clipping on narrow mobile screens.

### Minimal Floating (Tooltips)
Used for quick, un-interactable labels.

- **Background:** `bg-slate-900 dark:bg-black`
- **Text:** `text-white`
- **Radius:** `rounded-xl`
- **Shadow:** `shadow-xl`

## Backdrops

Any interface that blocks interaction with the rest of the application (e.g. `Modal`, `Dialog`, `Drawer`, `PlanningProgressOverlay`) must use the standard unified backdrop overlay:

- **Style:** `bg-void-900/50 backdrop-blur-sm`

## Feedback

Feedback surfaces indicate system status or asynchronous progress.

- **ActionFeedbackRegion / Toasts:** Must wrap contents in a consistent unified surface (e.g., standard background, border, shadow, and rounded radius) instead of relying on heavily saturated background colors, utilizing appropriate semantic text colors and faint borders to communicate status.
- **Async state semantics:** Pending and progress updates use polite `role="status"` announcements with `aria-busy` on the affected feedback region. Blocking errors use `role="alert"` and assertive live behavior only when the user must recover before continuing. Clear-error controls should not create nested alert regions.
- **Result announcements:** Warning feedback should remain polite. Success feedback may be polite when it is the first announcement for an operation, but shared inline feedback should avoid repeating success messages when a pending state already announced the operation and the visible success state is sufficient.
- **Progress equivalents:** Visual progress bars require text equivalents that remain available under reduced motion. Pending inline feedback should include percent-complete text when progress is known; hold-to-confirm controls should include visible percent text, progressbar values, and non-motion status copy.
- **Toast behavior:** Toast entrance, exit, and stack reordering motion uses shared `asyncFeedback`, `enterExit`, and `listReorder` tokens. Non-error overflow toasts may dismiss automatically to keep stacks bounded, but error toasts remain visible until dismissed or acted on. Retry controls expose pending state with `aria-busy`, suppress duplicate activation, and keep their accessible name stable.

### Global Notifications And Execution Toasts

- **Notification center composition:** The top-nav `NotificationPanel` combines global execution attention from `GET /api/notifications`, global startup readiness, and active scheduler entries for the selected project. The execution feed includes human intervention, task and sprint execution failures, automatic stops, and system errors from every project; it is not scoped to the project currently selected in the shell. Critical rows sort ahead of non-critical rows.
- **Context and details:** Execution rows show the sanitized project, sprint, and task context available for the source. Their Details modal contains Project, optional Sprint and Task, What went wrong, Why this needs attention, Recommended next steps, Timestamp, and Source context. Sprint-level records omit Task instead of inventing one. Opening Details or a direct action marks the row read.
- **Server-owned destinations:** Treat notification links as server-owned metadata. Use the supplied task target when task context exists, then the Live target for a sprint-run record, then sprint and project fallbacks. Anchors retain the supplied `href` for keyboard, assistive-technology, and browser fallback behavior; `TopNav` may delegate the same path and query parameters to the in-app router.
- **Navigation teardown:** Before a notification action delegates to the in-app router, close the Details modal and notification panel in that order. Restore focus to the notification trigger using the existing one-shot focus-open suppression so persistent navbar overlays remain closed while the destination route renders.
- **Read and dismiss identity:** Browser-local read and dismissed state uses the timestamp-versioned notification identity. An unchanged source stays read or dismissed across refreshes; a newer `updatedAt` version becomes actionable again.
- **Toast hydration:** Only actionable records from the global execution feed hydrate navbar toasts. The initial snapshot seeds the seen-version map without creating a burst of old toasts, and unchanged refresh or reconnect snapshots do not repeat them. A new source or newer timestamp produces one contextual warning toast containing project/sprint/task context. Warning toasts use the standard bottom-right stack and dismissal behavior. System errors use the dedicated persistent, assertive error-toast stack (`autoDismissMs: 0`) until dismissed or opened. Startup-readiness and selected-project scheduler rows remain in the notification center and do not enter this execution-toast hydration path.
- **Modal focus:** Notification Details uses the shared responsive `Modal`, initially focuses its close control, traps focus, supports Escape, and restores focus to the originating Details control. If a notification action removes its focused row control, focus returns to the panel or a safe page fallback.

## Motion & Interaction

- All motion must respect the user's OS preference (`useReducedMotion`).
- Rely on shared constants from `INTERACTION_TOKENS`, `useGsapInteractionTokens`, `GSAP_INTERACTION_TOKENS`, and `MODAL_MOTION` for unified entrance/exit easings, durations, destructive hold progress, and reduced-motion-safe resets.
- Avoid bypassing or faking timers during unmounts unless directly tied to the GSAP lifecycle to avoid layout jank or incomplete exits.

## Accessibility

- Ensure overlays (`Dialog`, `Modal`, `ConfirmDialog`) manage focus properly using `useFocusTrap`.
- Render shared dialogs through the document-body portal so transformed or animated page ancestors cannot displace fixed overlays. When a confirmation opens above a dialog, suspend the parent focus trap and mark its surface inert until the confirmation closes.
- Maintain appropriate ARIA attributes for semantic landmarks: `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`.
- Every dialog primitive must have an accessible name via `ariaLabel`, `ariaLabelledBy`, or `titleId`.
- `aria-describedby` must only be added if there is meaningful help or body text.
- All dialogs must use `useFocusTrap` to trap focus, restore focus on close, and allow `Escape` key dismissal even if backdrop clicks are disabled (unless the dialog represents a fully blocking workflow).
- Action feedback and toasts must use `role="status"` for polite announcements and `role="alert"` or `aria-live="assertive"` exclusively for destructive errors.
- Dismiss, retry, and clear-error controls must not leave keyboard focus on a removed element. If the original focused control is removed, restore focus to `[data-feedback-focus-fallback]`, `[data-focus-fallback]`, a main landmark, `#root`, or blur safely when no connected fallback exists; use `preventScroll` where supported.
- All badges, status dots, and live timing indicators must include visually hidden text (`<span className="sr-only">`) to provide explicit status and severity announcements, ensuring they do not rely purely on color or motion.
- Spinning or pinging indicators must respect reduced motion by using `motion-reduce:animate-none` or `motion-safe` variants.
- Notification panel reveal/list motion and toast entrance, dismissal, and reordering must resolve through the shared motion tokens. Reduced motion changes these states immediately while preserving severity text, read/unread text, context, action labels, focus behavior, and live-region announcements.
- Destructive hold-to-confirm buttons must communicate progress textually as well as visually. Releasing, pointer-cancelling, pointer-leaving, or key-up cancellation must reset progress immediately in reduced motion and must not call the destructive handler before the tokenized hold completes.
