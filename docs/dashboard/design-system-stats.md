# Dashboard Design System: Stats & Analytics

## Purpose

The `/stats` page is Code UX's project-scoped analytics workspace. It turns `ProjectExecutionStatsSnapshot` data, Git rollups, and invocation records into a dense operational surface for usage trends, composition, model performance, provider reliability, task and sprint ledgers, Git telemetry, and system invocation inspection.

Stats should feel aligned with the broader dashboard design system, but it is intentionally denser than the chat and overview surfaces. Chat remains a conversation workspace, Overview remains a cross-project operations summary, and Stats is the place for repeated measurement, comparison, filtering, and audit-style review. For adjacent visual language, see [Chat Design System](design-system-chat.md), [Dashboard Design System Overview](design-system-overview.md), and [Usage Telemetry And Stats](../architecture/usage-telemetry-and-stats.md).

## Data Contract

Stats presentation must stay within the implemented snapshot and invocation contracts:

- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/stats?window=1h|24h|7d|30d|all|custom&from=YYYY-MM-DD&to=YYYY-MM-DD` returns the project snapshot.
- The snapshot includes project identity, active sprint metadata, query and normalized range metadata, generated time, usage totals, status counts, adaptive buckets, chart series, task/sprint/provider/purpose/model summaries, Git totals and buckets, and optional merge-conflict count.
- Recent snapshot windows are bucket aligned and half-open while including the latest current bucket: `1h` keeps twelve 5-minute buckets through the current 5-minute bucket end, `24h` keeps twenty-four hourly buckets through the current partial hour, and daily/custom windows include their selected end day or bucket.
- Usage totals include invocation count, active and wall time, input/cached/output/reasoning/total tokens, cost fields, optional tool-call count, and usage-source counters for `reported`, `estimated`, `unavailable`, and `unsupported`.
- System mode uses `useSystemViewData(projectId)` and invocation APIs for records, server-projected filters, sort state, pagination, summaries, and transcript expansion.
- `project.execution.updated` and `snapshot_required` invalidate the aggregate Stats snapshot and the independent System invocation query. Both paths refetch their REST projections; realtime payloads do not become invocation records in the browser.
- System records remain sourced from paginated `GET /api/projects/:projectId/execution/invocations` responses. Cached cards and rows remain visible during the debounced/background refresh.
- Stats refreshes independently from Live's heavier `project.live.updated` snapshot, which retains a five-second server throttle. Do not route Stats freshness through the Live snapshot or imply that preparation-only workflow visibility is provider usage.

Do not document or render speculative metrics. Missing telemetry is a first-class state and must remain visibly different from a meaningful zero.

## Page Structure

The redesigned Stats page uses a stable top-to-bottom shell:

1. Header command band
   - Stats uses the same `PageContainer` width and responsive `64px / 56px` desktop padding rhythm as other v2 pages. Do not override the root padding or section gap from page-local CSS.
   - The unboxed page introduction follows the shared `PageHeader` scale: a restrained 30px desktop title, 14px supporting copy, and 10px tracked caps only for the eyebrow. Active lens and project context use simple metadata rows with hairline separation instead of a framed hero or stack of status pills.
   - The command controls are the only framed header rail. On wide screens, snapshot-window and analysis-view controls sit side by side with a hairline divider; on narrow screens they stack and wrap without horizontal page overflow. Avoid nested framed material panels, decorative gradients, or extra wrappers around the preset, custom range, and mode controls.
   - Keep only selected project, generated snapshot time, sprint lens, time window, and active visual mode controls visible in the command band.
   - Time presets are `1h`, `24h`, `7d`, `30d`, `All time`, and `Custom`.
   - Choosing `Custom` opens start and end date fields. The selected range changes only after `Apply` succeeds.
   - Invalid or incomplete custom ranges keep focusable controls visible, keep Apply keyboard-reachable, set `aria-invalid` on the first invalid field, connect `aria-errormessage`, move focus to that field on failed apply, and announce inline error text.
   - Successful preset and custom range changes produce short polite status copy such as `Time window changed to 24h.` or `Custom range applied: 2026-06-26 to 2026-07-03.` without changing the stats API query contract.
2. Mode navigation
   - The mode rail is a responsive segmented grid with icon-first buttons and stable accessible labels in this order: `Trend`, `Composition`, `Cost`, `Models`, `Providers`, `Ledgers`, and `System`.
   - The visible `Providers` label maps to the internal reliability mode. Keep user-facing copy and tests aligned if this mapping changes.
   - The rail uses `role="group"` and `aria-pressed`; it is not a tablist because mode changes replace the whole analysis workspace.
   - The active mode also has a screen-reader-only polite status so compact controls communicate selected-state changes without changing their pressed-button semantics.
   - Active mode movement uses `selectionMovement` timing and a visible selected surface. Reduced motion removes movement while preserving the pressed state, active fill, icon, and status copy.
3. Metric deck
   - The hero remains a command header only: page title, selected project, sprint lens, time-window controls, and mode navigation.
   - Mode-specific top cards are the single primary metric deck for the selected analysis surface. They use `StatsCard` and should put the most actionable metric first for the selected mode.
   - Cards expose title, value, and string description as the analytics article name. Long values must wrap inside stable card slots.
4. Workspace body
   - Mode content starts directly after the metric deck with a compact flat metadata strip for the active mode, not a decorative studio header, readiness chip, duplicated KPI strip, summary-card deck, or duplicated workspace context card.
   - Workspace bodies may differ substantially, but each component must consume the shared Stats panel, chip, input, ledger row, status tone, chart track, focus, and motion tokens directly.
5. Feedback states
   - No-project, first-load loading, first-load error, empty, refresh, and reduced-data states preserve the shell rhythm.
   - Loading states use polite status semantics. Error states use alert semantics and expose retry when recovery is available.
- Refresh states keep existing analytics visible where cached data exists. Mark the affected chart, table, transcript, or page region with `aria-busy` and add visible/polite status text instead of using animation alone.
- Background refresh states for mode workspaces and invocation ledgers keep cached rows/cards on screen. They add visible polite copy that says the data is updating from cache, while first-load states may still use skeleton or empty loading panels.

## Visual Modes

Mode-specific implementations live under `dashboard/src/v2/pages/stats/components/`. Keep reusable primitives in `stats-ui-primitives.tsx` and the `StatsShared.tsx` compatibility barrel; add mode-specific behavior in the relevant studio file.

### Trend

Trend is the chart-first workspace for time-series telemetry.

- Lead with throughput, runtime, cost, invocations, cache rate, and token velocity.
- Do not render a second Trend KPI band inside the studio. The mode metric deck owns total tokens, invocations, active time, cost, and cache-rate summaries; the Trend studio starts with compact secondary signal cards and then the chart.
- Keep chart state centralized through `use-usage-chart-state.ts`; chart filters change series visibility, not the selected time window.
- The chart header keeps filter access and zoom reset visible near the graph title. The toolbar summarizes selected range, bucket count, resolution, and active zoom.
- The graph frame, filter flyout, focused-bucket panel, tooltip, minimap, and series controls use the shared flat panel, subpanel, chip, and focus primitives. Keep semantic series colors on chart lines, swatches, and bucket markers rather than on selected control chrome.
- The primary plot should use a tall, viewport-bounded canvas area so the graph remains the dominant element in Trend mode.
- Avoid visible chart-summary card decks above the plot. Keep chart summary text in the screen-reader summary and expose exact values through focused-bucket inspection.
- Short daily windows show compact bucket labels under the overview strip so the minimap carries its own context without relying only on the main x-axis labels.
- Series controls sit in a full-width band under the usage graph, grouped into readable categories such as totals, token details, source confidence, providers, models, purposes, and Git. Section headers show active/total counts, rows show the series color, readable label, signal type, and visible On/Off text. Each row control uses `role="switch"` with `aria-checked`, and the visible switch state must match the accessible on/off state.
- The full-width series band and graph filter menu must consume the same chart-series view model from `useUsageChartState`: section order, labels, active counts, total counts, default-enabled counts, and reset defaults should not be recomputed differently in rendered components. Reset restores the snapshot default series, while enable-defaults turns default series on without clearing additional operator selections; both actions announce the resulting active-series count.
- Hover, keyboard focus, minimap selection, drag zoom, and active bucket controls all update the same focused-bucket summary; avoid a second live-values panel that repeats those values. The focused-bucket card fills the height of its chart-side column, caps to the graph height, and scrolls internally when the graph is tall.
- The focused-bucket tooltip distinguishes idle, focused, and pinned inspection states in visible copy and polite tooltip text. Marker position has a text equivalent such as `Focused bucket marker at 45 percent of the visible chart window` so color and motion are not the only cues.
- Chart announcements should describe completed operator actions, not pointer movement frames: focused bucket changes, pinned buckets, drag/minimap zoom ranges, zoom reset, series enable/disable counts, last-series guard reasons, refresh/stale/error status, ready/completed refresh status, and empty data recovery. Dragging may update selection bounds visually, but live-region copy should fire only when a zoom is committed or reset.
- Filter menus focus the first useful series control when opened, close on Escape, and restore focus to the trigger when possible. The last enabled series remains focusable with `aria-disabled` rather than native `disabled`; activating it leaves the series on and announces an explicit guard reason so operators can discover why it cannot be turned off.
- Reduced motion renders chart paths, points, focus rings, minimap selection bounds, and tab state as static geometry. Do not rely on draw-in path animation, point scaling, sliding tab content, or moving bounds to reveal values or selected state.
- The visible SVG, readable chart summary, and screen-reader-only table must agree on peak tokens, peak active time, average tokens, invocation peak, active series, and zoom range.

### Composition

Composition explains where usage comes from.

- Lead with provider share, token mix, cache rate, output/reasoning proportions, source mix, purpose lanes, and available Git-blocker context.
- The mode metric deck remains the only executive KPI band. The Composition workspace begins with a two-column analytical canvas instead of repeating provider, token, cache, output, and reasoning summary cards.
- Token anatomy shows total volume, the accessible token-flow bar, separate input/cached/output/reasoning lanes, and a plain-language cache-efficiency callout. Total cost appears in runtime context only when `totalCostUsd` is greater than zero.
- Provider distribution uses a compact proportional strip and ranked rows with exact token/share text. Segment colors stay inside the data strip and swatches; long labels wrap and empty segments render an explicit no-data state.
- Purpose lanes rank intent in rows with invocation count, active time, token volume, and share. Runtime context keeps active time, wall time, utilization, and optional spend adjacent without creating another KPI deck.
- Provider activity is a compact ledger ordered by token volume. Desktop rows align provider identity, token distribution, calls, cache rate, tokens per call, active time, and optional cost beneath one shared column header; narrow layouts retain visible per-value labels. The enclosing sheet owns the radius while rows use hairline separators and quiet hover emphasis.
- Source-confidence cards distinguish reported, estimated, unavailable, unsupported, and defensive unknown buckets without inventing alternate totals.
- Distribution strips and flow bars need nearby text or `role="img"` labels so color is never the only signal.

### Cost

Cost is the pricing-aware spend workspace for the current project and time window.

- The metric deck leads with total spend, average per task, average per canonical sprint, blended cost per million tokens, and pricing coverage. All monetary values use adaptive precision and retain provenance; a partially priced value is a minimum, not a complete total.
- `CostStudio` derives `CostAnalyticsViewModel` once from the existing Stats snapshot and composes the executive overview and spend trend, token/spend allocation, model/purpose rankings, and task/canonical-sprint ledger. Cost must not issue another request or maintain a separate settings or persistence protocol.
- Average per task and average per sprint use distinct entities with at least one provider invocation. Covered `$0.00` entities remain in the denominator. Sprint averages and rows use `costAnalytics.sprints`, which combines reruns of the same conceptual sprint; legacy snapshots fall back to the run-oriented `sprints` array only when that additive projection is absent.
- Token allocation defines input, cached input, output excluding separately reported reasoning when necessary, and reasoning lanes. Spend allocation defines input, cached-input, output, and provider-reported fallback cost lanes, reconciled to snapshot totals.
- Pricing provenance is invocation-count based: configured model pricing and provider-reported fallback calls are covered, uncovered calls are unpriced, and legacy rows without `costCoverage` are unknown. Partial coverage shows a priced subtotal and never claims completeness.
- Fully covered zero-cost usage may display `$0.00`; unpriced usage displays `Unpriced`, legacy usage displays `Coverage unknown`, and an empty window displays `Unavailable`. Never describe an unpriced zero total as free.
- Operators should maintain current per-model input and output prices in **Settings → Model Pricing**, verify the active System or Project scope, and refresh Stats after saving. Catalogue or override prices affect estimates and historical projections, not provider invoices or stored invocation telemetry.

### Models

Models compares model activity, latency, reliability, and efficiency.

- The overview uses the flat Stats panel language to balance model-share distribution, efficiency highlights, total window volume, and low-data states without decorative depth.
- The leaderboard ranks by `usage.totalTokens` descending with label tie-breaks.
- Rows surface success tone, p50/p95 latency, tokens per call, output velocity, cache-hit rate, reasoning share, provider identity, pricing stats, and token-flow anatomy when those fields are present.
- Model pricing stats use `usage.totalCostUsd` and should show total cost, cost per invocation, and blended cost per million tokens only when a positive cost signal exists.
- Missing model arrays, zero model usage, zero duration samples, and low invocation counts render as explicit low-data states.
- Long model and provider names must wrap within stable cards and rows; chips and metrics cannot force horizontal page overflow.

### Providers

Providers is the reliability studio.

- The visible mode label is `Providers`; the studio title may describe reliability.
- Start with confidence, fallback usage, failure pressure, and provider coverage before detailed rows.
- Source mix explicitly shows reported, estimated, unavailable, unsupported, and unknown invocation-source counts. Estimated data is usable but lower precision.
- Telemetry Source Mix, Provider Share, Confidence Board, Provider Breakdown, and Audit Notes follow the same flat hierarchy as Composition: neutral compact metadata chips, small radii, hairline borders, and no animated elevation or glow treatments.
- Provider cards sort by computed risk first and token volume second, then show failure count, success-rate tone, token volume, pricing stats, active time, duration coverage, and source confidence.
- Provider pricing stats use `usage.totalCostUsd` and should show total cost, cost per invocation, and blended cost per million tokens only when a positive cost signal exists.
- Provider status and latency details may be derived from matching model summaries, but health must not be fabricated when model/status telemetry is absent.
- Empty provider or source segments use shared Stats panels and explain what data is missing.

### Ledgers

Ledgers contains operational records for tasks, sprints, and Git.

- Task Telemetry, Sprint Telemetry, and Git Telemetry are real tabs with accessible tab semantics, stable labels, and count badges.
- Ledger tablists, compact summary strips, integrated search/sort toolbars, progressive sentinels, empty states, task/sprint rows, and Git leaderboard rows use the flat Stats panel, input, and ledger-row primitives. The ledger is one enclosing workbench surface rather than summary cards nested inside a large card.
- Task and sprint rows form a continuous scan sheet with hairline separators, no per-row floating-card gap, quiet hover fill, and wrapping metadata. Keep only semantic status as a compact badge; provider, purpose, secondary labels, and percentile context read as text. Rows expose calls, active time, cost, recency, visible-total share, leader share, token-flow anatomy, and p50/p95 values.
- Filter comparison and visible-result summaries are integrated strips within the workbench, not additional elevated cards.
- Git rows keep churn separate from token flow. Use `ChurnFlowBar` for insertions and deletions, and keep pull requests, merges, files, conflicts, visible share, and leader share readable.
- Search, sort, and progressive rendering preserve the `useProgressiveList` flow: visible items, scroll container, and sentinel stay wired together.
- Sort controls use buttons with `aria-pressed` when they represent local ordering choices.
- Sort controls expose the current direction in both visible icon state and accessible names such as `Tokens, sorted descending` or `Latest, not sorted`.
- Ledger search, sorting, tab changes, and progressive visible-row changes expose concise polite status copy such as `Showing 8 of 20 tasks, sorted by Tokens descending` or `Sprint Telemetry selected, 2 entries`. Keep cached rows visible during these updates; movement should orient operators through `listReorder` or `selectionMovement` tokens but must not be the only signal.
- Ledger tab indicators and selected records use `selectionMovement`; progressive rendering, sorting, and visible-row changes use `listReveal` or `listReorder` depending on whether rows are entering or moving. Reduced motion snaps these changes while leaving count badges, selected states, and row labels visible.

### System

System is the administrative invocation workbench. It is the place to inspect sprint state, invocation health, integration traffic, categorized failures, filtered records, and transcript detail without leaving the Stats workspace.

- `useSystemViewData(projectId)` owns filters, sorting, summaries, pagination, request cancellation, and the legacy array fallback used by older tests.
- Summary sections are named administrative regions: `Sprint State`, `Health Snapshot`, `External API Activity`, and `Error Categories`. Each region uses the same panel frame, compact eyebrow, section-level count, and subpanel metric cards so operators can scan state before entering the ledger.
- System summary cards, filters, invocation table rows, sticky headers, loading rows, and transcript panels share the same flat Stats primitives as Ledgers. Keep the workbench compact and bordered, with semantic status fills only where the data state requires them.
- Sprint State separates active sprint/task state from invocation health. Zero active sprint is neutral information, while running, blocked, failed, and completed signals use semantic status fills rather than decorative color.
- Invocation Health owns invocation volume, token flow, success rate, average and p95 duration, cache-hit rate, running count, and status distribution. Empty or reduced health data is a polite status state and must not imply universal success.
- External API Activity isolates classified Git, Code UX Agent, Jira, and other integration calls from model invocation records. Empty copy should say that no external API activity was classified, not that integrations never ran.
- Error Categories show classified timeout, rate-limit, API, model, cancelled, and other failures with semantic warning/negative/neutral fills. Empty copy should describe no classified errors in the current data set.
- The record view control is a connected, non-sticky segmented button group mounted inside the records work area for `All`, `Errors`, and `System Msgs`. Count slots stay visually quiet and width-stable; visible badges can be hidden from assistive technology only when each button's accessible name includes the exact count and record pluralization.
- `SystemFilterBar` presents search and status as the primary row, then groups purpose, provider, and error-category chips below inside one composed flat administrative control surface. Result count, active-filter count, clear-all, and invocation pagination metadata stay visible in the footer of that control surface.
- Invocation tables are the System ledger. They preserve a semantic caption, sticky desktop header, `scope="col"` headers, active-column `aria-sort`, explicit sort button labels, and per-cell `headers` relationships. Mobile rows may collapse into block cards, but each cell keeps its visible label because the desktop header is hidden below large breakpoints.
- Expand controls name the target invocation, set `aria-expanded`, point at the transcript panel with `aria-controls`, and remain keyboard-accessible.
- Transcript detail surfaces invocation status, model, duration, token flow, cached tokens, message count, role, created time, optional message metadata, errors, and long content with safe wrapping. The expanded transcript panel uses shared flat Stats primitives for its header, compact invocation summary row, status chips, role records, copy control, loading, empty, and error states.
- Transcript regions set `aria-busy` while messages load. Transcript loading and empty states use polite status semantics; transcript fetch failures use alert semantics and keep the expand control keyboard-accessible for recovery.
- System feedback states use compact flat subpanels with semantic Lucide icons, short operational copy, and named `status` or `alert` regions. Loading and empty/reduced-data states are polite and include visible text beyond motion, while blocking invocation and transcript failures use alert semantics. Copy must distinguish no classified activity or unavailable metrics from proven zero usage.

## Telemetry Semantics

Stats copy and visuals should teach operators how trustworthy a number is without overstating precision:

- `reported` means the provider supplied authoritative usage.
- `estimated` means Code UX derived usage from prompt/transcript text or provider-adjacent artifacts.
- `unavailable` means the provider ran but no usable counts could be derived.
- `unsupported` means the provider intentionally does not participate in token telemetry.
- `unknown` may appear only as a defensive frontend bucket when known source counters do not account for all invocations in the current snapshot.

Cost values come from snapshot cost fields and should only be presented when configured data makes them meaningful. Do not imply a free run from a zero cost when pricing may be unavailable.

Cost displays use two fractional digits for ordinary values and adaptive precision for sub-cent values. Focused chart buckets and the screen-reader data table preserve the exact normalized USD value so scan-friendly headlines never remove recoverable detail.

CLI task-coding analytics distinguish workflow visibility from provider usage. A running execution invocation may appear while Code UX is preparing a cancellable workspace or waiting to claim provider capacity. Provider `started_at`, duration, concurrency, token, and cost telemetry begin only after the provider claim/run starts; preparation failure or pre-claim cancellation therefore leaves an auditable execution row without fabricated provider usage.

## Primitives And Styling

Use page-scoped Stats primitives instead of one-off analytics chrome. The Stats surface vocabulary is a warm void hierarchy:

- `stats-theme.css` defines Stats-specific aliases for panel surfaces, subpanels, chips, inputs, focus rings, status fills, borders, minimal focus shadows, and motion.
- `PANEL_CLASS`, `SUBPANEL_CLASS`, `CHIP_CLASS`, `INPUT_CLASS`, `LEDGER_ROW_CLASS`, `LEDGER_ROW_MODERN_CLASS`, `STATUS_TONE_CLASS`, `TAB_ACTIVE_CLASS`, `TAB_IDLE_CLASS`, `DASHED_EMPTY_CLASS`, and `TRACK_CLASS` provide the shell vocabulary.
- `StatsCard`, `StudioHeader`, `SignalMetricCard`, `DonutCard`, `PurposeRibbon`, `TokenChip`, `TokenFlowBar`, `ChurnFlowBar`, `SortButton`, `ViewToggle`, and `SeriesLegendButton` cover repeated Stats patterns.
- Typed view-model helpers should own reusable derivations for trend, chart, model, provider, and ledger projections. `stats-page-view-model.ts` owns page-level snapshot derivations such as usage defaults, token/active/wall time series, planning lookup, provider/source/token segments, and completion-confidence copy so `useStatsPageData` can stay focused on fetch state, date controls, and chart state. Avoid recalculating meaningful bucket or efficiency summaries directly in JSX or stateful hooks.
- New or touched Stats surfaces should use semantic Stats variables for backgrounds, borders, text, status tones, focus rings, chart tracks, selection fills, and scrims instead of raw slate/white/black light-dark utility pairs.
- Signal fills, chart strokes, metric sparklines, selected controls, and Stats card accents must resolve through `--stats-accent-signal`, `--stats-accent-signal-fill`, or `--signal-rgb`. Light mode uses the dashboard blue signal; dark mode keeps the warm void jade signal without per-component overrides that leak blue into dark surfaces.
- Stats typography follows the dashboard heading scale directly: the page title matches shared v2 introductions at 30px desktop, supporting copy stays at 14px, row metadata stays readable at 12–13px, section and studio headings use `text-xl`/`text-2xl font-semibold`, and 10px tracked caps are reserved for true eyebrows and column labels.
- Panels and stat cards are grounded warm void work surfaces with solid `--stats-surface-*` tokens, smaller Stats-specific radii, hairline borders, and near-flat structural shadows. They should feel administrative, compact, and durable without blue ambient color.
- Chips, tabs, inputs, subpanels, summary rows, and table cells are flat primitives. Use quiet fills, fixed control geometry, compact labels, small radii, and neutral selected states instead of decorative capsules, glow, animated elevation, or nested decorative cards.
- Status fills are semantic. Signal, positive, warning, negative, neutral, and cyan tones should communicate running, success, warning, failure, informational, or data-accent meaning; avoid using them as ambient decoration.
- Backdrop blur is not a primary Stats material. Do not add `backdrop-blur-*`, shared translucent material tokens, large glow washes, or translucent chrome to panels, chips, inactive legend controls, ledger rows, System filters, invocation tables, or transcript detail as the default treatment.
- Do not fix design drift with broad page-root `:global()` color or spacing overrides. Tokenize the owning component or extend the shared primitive vocabulary so Trend, Composition, Cost, Models, Providers, Ledgers, and System stay consistent without hidden CSS bridges.
- Metric cards with sparkline micrographs use the standard card surface, not a separate muted graph background. The sparkline must fit its own stable slot so hover glow and line geometry are not cut off by card overflow. Populated sparklines expose a concise `role="img"` summary with point count and high/low values; empty sparkline slots show a static `No sparkline data` label and an explicit no-data `role="img"` description.

Dense analytics layouts should stay calm: restrained contrast, low-opacity fills, semantic color, stable grids, and short labels. Avoid nested decorative cards; repeated cards, ledger rows, modals, and tool panels may be framed, while page sections should read as workspaces.

## Architecture

The `StatsPage` uses the `useStatsPageData` hook to coordinate visual modes. The hook manages and exposes state including `activeQuery`, `visualMode`, `chartState`, `providerSegments`, `sourceSegments`, `tokenSegments`, and `planningUsage`, ensuring seamless transitions across Trend, Composition, Cost, Models, Providers, Ledgers, and System views. The selected mode remains scoped to the same per-project storage key, and unknown persisted values fall back to Composition.

`cost-insights.ts` is the pure frontend boundary for Cost calculations and display state. Cost components consume its normalized totals, rates, averages, reconciled spend/token segments, deterministic dimension rows, and task/canonical-sprint details instead of re-deriving values in JSX. Every monetary amount carries coverage provenance so complete zero-price usage, partial pricing, unpriced telemetry, legacy unknown coverage, and empty data remain distinct.

Cost allocation panels pair separate token and spend graphics with exact textual legends. Token lanes cover input, cached input, output, and reasoning; spend lanes keep token-priced input, cached input, output, and provider-reported fallback spend distinct. Ranked model and execution-purpose rows show spend, tokens, calls, both shares, and cost per call. The first six rows remain visible and all additional rows reconcile into one bounded `Other` summary so source collection size does not expand the rendered ledger. Patterns, labels, focusable rows, and full provider/model identities make the breakdown usable without relying on color or pointer input.
`CostOverviewPanel` renders the Cost executive metrics and spend-over-time surface directly from that view model. Its SVG is presentation-only: every bucket is also a keyboard-focusable value with exact focused detail and a screen-reader table, while peak, selection, and missing-price states use shape or text cues in addition to color. The panel keeps no-usage, fully unpriced, partial, covered-zero, and single-bucket states explicit and page-overflow safe.

Task and canonical sprint averages use distinct rows that contain provider invocations. Covered zero-cost rows remain in the denominator, while an empty collection produces an unavailable amount. Canonical sprint rows come from `costAnalytics.sprints`; legacy snapshots fall back to the run-oriented `sprints` ledger only when the additive projection is absent.

The Cost task/sprint ledger consumes those prepared detail rows directly. Its Task and Sprint tabs support roving Arrow/Home/End navigation, and its Cost-local controls sort by spend, tokens, calls, cost per call, recency, or name without changing the general telemetry-ledger contract. Search totals include every matching row even when only an initial progressive batch is mounted; the displayed per-entity average remains the full conceptual task or canonical-sprint average so filtering cannot silently redefine the comparison baseline. Rows expose spend share, token mix, status, secondary context, recency, and full/partial/unpriced/unknown pricing provenance as wrapping semantic articles.

## Responsive Behavior

- The hero uses a two-zone command band on wide screens and stacks project context, time controls, and mode navigation on narrow screens.
- Fixed or sticky header-adjacent navigation must wrap before it clips. Header preset and mode controls should use bounded grids that move from compact multi-row layouts to a single row only when the command column has enough width; use `min-w-0`, wrapping labels, and component-local overflow only when wrapping can no longer preserve button labels.
- Metric grids collapse from desktop multi-column layouts to two-column and single-column layouts without changing order.
- Trend places focused-bucket and series context below the chart on narrow screens.
- Ledgers and system rows include mobile labels when the header row is visually unavailable.
- Tables, chart summaries, filter bars, date validation messages, pagination, and transcript panels must not create page-level horizontal scrolling.
- Touch targets and keyboard focus order remain usable at phone widths.

See [Mobile Responsiveness](mobile-responsiveness.md) for dashboard-wide constraints.

## Accessibility

- The page root is a named statistics region and marks itself busy during first-load telemetry.
- Mode navigation, time presets, filter chips, sort buttons, and invocation view controls expose selected state through ARIA attributes. Compact mode and invocation-view controls keep stable accessible names, visible focus rings, and arrow/Home/End keyboard navigation.
- Ledger navigation uses actual tab semantics. Keyboard focus should move from the active tab into the tabpanel controls and rows in DOM order.
- Charts expose a region name, readable summary, keyboard-reachable bucket targets, minimap bucket text, and a screen-reader-only table for exact values.
- Chart refresh indicators use semantic status text in addition to animation.
- Microvisuals such as sparklines, donuts, ribbons, token flow bars, churn bars, and status bars either expose a concise `role="img"` label or are paired with nearby text that communicates the same data. Full and near-full donut segments use split arcs so highly concentrated provider volume remains visible instead of collapsing into the track.
- Date inputs have visible labels, programmatic labels, validation state, and inline alert text for invalid custom ranges.
- Invocation tables provide captions, active `aria-sort` only on the sorted column, explicit sort button labels, mobile cell labels, and wrapping-safe cells for long provider, model, error, and transcript text.
- Shared table primitives may announce result counts through polite status text and mark background refreshes with `aria-busy` without replacing cached rows. Sortable shared headers show a direction glyph and include `sorted ascending`, `sorted descending`, or `not sorted` in the control name.
- Shared sortable table headers set `aria-sort` consistently, including `none` for sortable inactive columns, and pair the glyph with an accessible sort label. Busy result announcements use concise copy such as `Updating results. 2 records shown.` while cached rows remain visible.
- System controls are grouped by purpose. Mode controls, time presets, record views, status filters, purpose filters, provider filters, error-category filters, and pagination controls use named groups rather than anonymous button clusters.
- System record-view buttons use `aria-pressed`, not tab semantics, because they are command-style filters for the records work area. Arrow, Home, and End handling should keep focus inside the group.
- System invocation tables preserve semantic header relationships: desktop headers use `scope="col"`, sortable headers set `aria-sort` only when active, and body cells reference their headers.
- Transcript panels expose a named region and set `aria-busy` while messages load. Loading and empty transcript blocks use polite status semantics; transcript errors use `role="alert"`.
- System loading, empty, no-project, no-records, reduced-data, and background-refresh states use visible polite copy. Blocking API, invocation-record, and transcript failures use alert errors with concrete recovery context when available.
- Focus rings use `--stats-focus-ring` or shared dashboard focus tokens and remain visible in light and dark themes.
- Repeated visible labels are acceptable when they reflect real UI structure. Tests should disambiguate by role, group name, region, or scoped queries.
- Custom date range validation uses visible labels, `aria-invalid`, `aria-errormessage`, and inline alert text. Invalid or incomplete ranges keep the controls visible and focusable until corrected.
- Stats loading, empty, low-data, reduced-data, and background-refresh states use polite live-region copy. Blocking API failures and unrecoverable transcript errors use alert semantics. Numeric metric values remain static text; surrounding detail or micrograph containers may animate but must never obscure exact values from assistive technology.

## Motion

Motion is for orientation only: shell entrance, mode transitions, card detail refreshes, chart updates, hover feedback, and tab changes should be subtle. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` by disabling nonessential GSAP, Tailwind entrance, card, chart, and tab animation. Never rely on motion to reveal validation errors, filter state, table content, or chart values, and never animate numeric text in a way that obscures exact values for assistive technology.

- Use `controlFeedback` for time presets, filters, sort buttons, series switches, pagination buttons, and expand controls.
- Use `selectionMovement` for mode detail movement, active tab indicators, selected ledger views, metric-card detail refreshes, and small micrograph emphasis.
- Use `listReveal` for progressive ledger and invocation row entrance.
- Use `listReorder` when sorting or filtering repositions existing rows.
- Shared table rows expose `listReorder` as their reorder motion contract. Reduced motion snaps row reveal and reorder changes while leaving row labels, result counts, and sort icons visible.
- List-window controls use `listReorder` timing for visible-count changes and a static polite range announcement such as `Showing 1 to 20 of 45 tasks`; under reduced motion, the state text remains while transition classes snap.
- Use `inlineValidation` for custom date range errors.
- Use `asyncFeedback` for chart refresh overlays and `ActionFeedbackRegion` states in usage graph loading/error/empty surfaces.

## Verification Guidance

For documentation-only Stats changes without TypeScript or TSX examples, run repository lint/typecheck and verify discoverability:

```bash
pnpm run lint
rg "System|stats" docs/dashboard/design-system-stats.md docs/index.md docs/SUMMARY.md
```

For Stats UI changes, run focused tests first. `pnpm run test:dashboard` covers `tests/dashboard`; source-adjacent Stats tests under `dashboard/src/v2/pages/stats/__tests__/` should be run directly when those components change:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run dashboard/src/v2/pages/stats/__tests__ tests/dashboard/stats
pnpm run test:dashboard
pnpm run typecheck:dashboard
```

The source-adjacent Stats suite includes System workbench regressions for named regions, grouped command/filter controls, semantic invocation table headers, transcript feedback states, wrapping-safe operational copy, and flat surfaces that avoid backdrop-blur utilities in touched System components.

Run `pnpm run build` when changes touch shared contracts, routing, CSS token boundaries, dashboard imports, or production bundling behavior. Do not record a check as passed unless it was run for the current change.
