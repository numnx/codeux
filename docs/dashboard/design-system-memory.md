# Memory Workspace Design System
## Objective
Make the Memory page feel like a focused knowledge graph tool.

## Category Colors
The Memory UI relies on specific hex colors that match existing app accents:
- **Architecture:** Signal (Teal) `#00E0A0` -> `r: 0, g: 224, b: 160`
- **Codebase:** Ember (Orange) `#FFB800` -> `r: 255, g: 184, b: 0`
- **Context:** Violet `#8B5CF6` -> `r: 139, g: 92, b: 246`
- **Preferences:** Slate `#94A3B8` -> `r: 148, g: 163, b: 184`
- **Patterns:** Amber/Ember variant `#F59E0B` -> `r: 245, g: 158, b: 11`
- **Decision:** Slate/Alternative `#64748B` -> `r: 100, g: 116, b: 139`
- **Error:** Rose `#F43F5E` -> `r: 244, g: 63, b: 94`
- **Learning:** Cyan/Teal `#33FFB8` -> `r: 51, g: 255, b: 184`

## Accessibility Rules
- **Memory Tier Tabs:** The tier controls use `role="tablist"` with `aria-label="Memory Tier"`. Keyboard navigation should fully support Arrow, Home, and End keys, and visually track `aria-selected` status.
- **Danger Mode:** Destructive toggles like "Lobotomize" use `aria-pressed` and include explicit visually hidden or text-visible labels (e.g. `aria-label="Toggle Danger Delete Mode"`) indicating the destructive nature.
- **Immediate Delete Warning:** When Lobotomize is active, the control must use explicit active-state danger styling and visible warning copy. The copy must say that single-click graph deletion is active and that inspector/sidebar single-memory delete controls do not show a confirmation dialog.
- **Memory Cards:** Memory cards must not be pointer-only. They should announce context, including scope and origin (e.g., via visually hidden instructional text like "Press Enter to open details" and explicitly mentioning the scope in the card's accessible label).
- **Search & Filtering:** Escape to clear behavior in the search box should update `aria-live` regions ("Search cleared") without unexpectedly blurring focus.

## Camera Contract
- **Overview Zoom:** The canvas opens at the default overview zoom and uses a lower entry zoom only for the initial entrance animation.
- **Selection Zoom:** Clicking a node or choosing it from the list recenters the map on that node at a readable focus zoom, while preserving the current zoom if the user has already zoomed in further.
- **Deep Readability:** The zoom buttons and wheel can reach a much deeper zoom than the old `2.5` cap so an individual memory can be read on dense 200+ node maps.
- **Pointer Zoom:** Wheel zoom should preserve the world point under the cursor instead of always scaling around the viewport center.
- **Screen-Space Marks:** Canvas nodes, memory labels, and category labels should use clamped inverse-zoom sizing so graph geometry scales while dots and text remain visually stable at deep zoom.
- **Focused Labels:** High-zoom canvas labels should prefer a single focused, wrapped label for the selected node instead of rendering full text for every node at once. Hover should only highlight nodes and update cursor state, not create card-like overlays.

## Responsive Layout Guidelines
- **Main Canvas:** Uses dynamic viewport height `h-[calc(100dvh-12rem)] min-h-[500px]` to keep the graph stable without clipping the page chrome.
- **Sidebar & Details:** The memory sidebar starts collapsed as a narrow rail so the canvas stays available by default. When expanded, it becomes a mobile drawer with an internal scrolling list and a desktop side rail.
- **Inspector Dock:** The inspector is a bottom sheet on mobile and a fixed right dock on desktop. Its scroll area is internal, the close button is always labeled, and the panel never blocks the ability to dismiss it.
- **Overlay Safety:** Zoom controls, legend, and node count live inside the canvas wrapper with safe offsets that move away from the inspector on desktop and stay reachable on mobile.
- **Header Filters & Actions:** The Memory header control surface groups tier summary tabs, current-scope copy, scope selectors, and actions into distinct rows. Tier tabs show Short Term and Long Term counts directly; the compact scope line uses the pattern `Short Term: showing 7 memories of 17 memories · Sprint 2 · All Agents` or `Long Term: showing 1 memory of 1 memory · Project-wide · All Agents`.
- **Filters & Search:** Filter controls wrap into multiple rows with `flex-wrap`, `min-w-0`, stable flex bases, and `max-w-full` so tier tabs, sprint selectors, agent selectors, model catalog, add memory, and danger actions never force horizontal scrolling.
- **Header Actions:** Add Memory, Model Catalog, and Danger Delete are visually separated from selectors. Model Catalog keeps `aria-pressed`, shown/hidden text, and active-model status visible. Danger Delete keeps `aria-pressed`, Off/Armed button text, and persistent explanatory copy visible in both states.
- **Sidebar Search:** The expanded memory sidebar includes a visible search field above the list. Search filters are debounced and optional; clearing the field must restore the full alive memory list for the current tier/filter context.
- **Truncation:** Metadata limits string lengths gracefully using `truncate`, `break-words`, and compact badges for connected-memory details.

## Model Catalog
- The embedding model catalog uses one Warm Void panel instead of a plain grid. The panel should feel quiet and operational, with low-contrast surfaces, restrained borders, and a header that summarizes available, downloaded, stale, and active model state before the card grid.
- Model cards use a compact Warm Void standard (`min-h-[17rem]`, modest padding, restrained radius, and low elevation) while keeping model name, status, description, dimension, size, language, progress, stale count, and action controls in stable regions so one-column mobile and two-column desktop layouts remain scannable.
- Model catalog action controls use compact `min-h-9` buttons with wrapped labels, visible Signal Jade focus rings, and icon-only delete affordances sized consistently with the rest of the card chrome.
- Signal Jade is the primary action treatment for download, activate, active, downloaded-progress, and re-embedding progress states. Use it for the user's next constructive model action and avoid competing violet primary buttons in the catalog.
- Ember is reserved for stale embedding messaging and re-embed prompts. Stale copy should be direct and actionable without making the entire card feel destructive.
- Status red is reserved for unavailable/error states and delete affordances. Delete remains a quiet icon-only destructive action with an explicit accessible name, visible focus ring, and disabled state for the active model.

## Sidebar Contract
- The expanded sidebar opens to the current alive memory list so users can browse all visible memories without starting from search. Closing the sidebar clears transient search and selection state so hidden filters do not linger behind the rail.
- The collapse/expand toggle must remain visible in both states and the arrow should point toward the next action, not the current state.
- The sidebar list should own the scrolling region; nested scroll containers inside the drawer cause clipped results and poor touch behavior on mobile.
- Memory cards in the sidebar use a dense Warm Void layout with a category rail, compact scope/strength metadata, a wrapped content title, and a bottom action row. Selected and batch-selected states should be clear through border/ring/accent changes without growing controls or adding empty space, and lobotomize mode keeps deletion visible as a compact destructive action.
