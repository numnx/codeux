# Memory Architecture and Search

Code UX differentiates context into three distinct contracts:
1. **Memory (Evidence and Claims)**: What the runtime *learns* automatically from work. Short-term sprint memories serve as evidence, which are promoted to long-term durable claims via remediation.
2. **Knowledge Base**: Curated reference documents added by users, chunked, and embedded.
3. **Persistent Skills**: Reusable agent instructions stored in project-owned skill storages and attached to agents.

Code UX uses semantic embeddings to retrieve relevant project context ("memories") during tasks. This guide outlines memory search, embedding provider selection, and remediation.

## Dashboard localization boundary

The Memory route follows the dashboard's active English or German locale. Page and map controls, tier and scope filters, search status, cards and inspectors, confirmations, validation, empty/loading/error guidance, accessible announcements, and embedding-model actions are translated. Dates, counts, strengths, percentages, sizes, and plural forms use locale-aware formatting, and localized category terms participate in text search without changing the stable stored category key.

Localization is a presentation-only boundary. Memory content, claims, evidence, tags, agent names, model IDs and descriptions, language and license metadata, URLs, filenames, and server/API diagnostics remain verbatim. No memory schema, embedding data, vector operation, API route, camera calculation, or deletion behavior depends on the selected locale.

## Embedding Providers

Memory embeddings can run through either backend:
- `in_app`: downloaded ONNX models managed from the Memory page. The built-in catalog lives in `src/services/embedding-model-catalog.ts` and includes:
  - `all-minilm-l6-v2`
  - `all-mpnet-base-v2`
  - `bge-small-en-v1.5`
  - `bge-base-en-v1.5`
  - `bge-large-en-v1.5`
  - `multilingual-e5-large`
- Custom in-app entries are stored in memory settings under `customEmbeddingModels`. The backend accepts only Hugging Face model repositories or `https://huggingface.co/...` file URLs, normalizes them to `owner/repo` plus repository-relative ONNX/tokenizer paths, and downloads through Hugging Face `resolve/main` URLs. Custom entries keep their own display name, ONNX model path, tokenizer files, dimension, approximate size, language, and validation status.
- `external_api`: an OpenAI-compatible embeddings endpoint configured in Settings → Memory with `baseUrl`, `apiKey`, `model`, and optional `dimensions`.

`MemoryService` resolves the effective project settings before capture, search, map generation, stale-count checks, and re-embedding. External API dimensions can be inferred from the returned vector, so models with custom vector sizes can be stored safely in `embeddingDimension`.

Custom in-app models appear beside built-ins in `GET /api/embedding-models`. `POST /api/embedding-models/custom` creates or updates a sanitized Hugging Face catalog entry, while the existing download, cancel, select, delete, and status routes accept custom IDs after the entry exists. Selection still requires the local ONNX file and required tokenizer files to be present, so a custom model cannot become active before its download completes.

## Memory Search Behavior

When an agent searches for relevant memories, it submits a query. Sprint OS follows a robust multi-step retrieval process using `MemoryService.search`.


### Memory Content-Size Boundaries
- `maxSprintMemories`: Default is 200 (max short-term memories captured per sprint).
- `maxProjectMemories`: Default is 1000 (max long-term memories at project scope).
- `remediationMaxPromotions`: Default is 12 (max memories promoted to claims per remediation run).
- `mapMaxEdgesPerNode`: Default is 3 (max visual edges per memory node).

### 1. Filtering

Before computing similarity scores, candidate memories are loaded from the repository based on hard criteria to prevent over-fetching:

- **Project ID**: The base boundary for all knowledge. Cross-project reads are explicitly prevented.
- **Scope**: Memories can be filtered by their scope bounds (e.g., `project`, `sprint`, or `agent`).
- **Sprint ID**: Optionally filters to knowledge explicitly bound to a given sprint.
- **Agent Preset ID**: Optionally filters to knowledge specific to an agent persona.
- **Dimension Matching**: Ensures only embeddings created with the currently loaded Embedding Model's dimension size are selected for comparison. This prevents errors when the default embedding model is swapped.
- **Maximum Candidates**: To protect local runtimes from unbounded scans, a defensive maximum limit of 10,000 candidate records is applied during loading.

### 2. Ranking and Scoring

Once candidates are loaded, the following steps are executed:

1. **Cosine Similarity**: The cosine similarity is computed between the query's vector and each candidate memory's vector. Candidates that fall below the caller-specified `minSimilarity` threshold (default is `0.3`) are pruned.
2. **Bounded Top-K Selection**: Instead of sorting all qualifying candidates at the end, a bounded selection of size `limit` (default `20`) is maintained and incrementally sorted in descending order. When candidates have equal similarity scores, they are ordered deterministically alphabetically by memory ID. `searchClaims` queries project-scope memories with a limit of `max(limit, 50)` before deduplicating against identical normalized claims.

### 3. Hydration

To preserve memory efficiency, the core scoring and sorting operate strictly on dense vectors. The full textual payloads and metadata of the top-ranking results are subsequently hydrated using a single batch repository fetch (`MemoryRepository.getMemories(topIds)`). The service then restores the scored order, returning a list of `MemorySearchResult` objects ready to feed the agent context windows.

## Remediation Schedules

Long-term memory remediation runs via the Code UX Scheduler (target type: `memory_remediation`) at scheduled frequencies, or manually via `PUT /api/projects/:projectId/scheduler/memory-remediation`.

- **Deterministic Mode**: Deletes duplicates automatically by normalising content (lowercase and whitespace-collapsed) and keeping only the record with the highest `strength` (with newest `updatedAt` as a tie-breaker). It also automatically purges CI failure memories (e.g., categories containing CI errors or `ci_failure_learning` origin).
- **AI Mode**: Evaluates cleanup candidates by calling the LLM to return a structured JSON list of specific memory IDs to promote or delete. Checked against the `long-term-memory-remediation` guardrail.

## Restart-Safe Re-embedding

Memory re-embedding tracks progress safely across restarts. The backend iterates through all memories tracking which have `embeddingModelId` matching the currently active model. If interrupted, the re-embedding process resumes from where it left off on the next request, rather than starting over, preventing duplicate work and ensuring atomicity.

## Graph Visualization

When the UI generates visual graphs of memory items:
- If a valid memory embedding map is present, the layout and edges match the exact vectors provided by the embedding model.
- If no embedding map is present (or embeddings are still generating), a local fallback algorithm creates a deterministic layout. To preserve front-end performance on dense graphs, fallback category edges are bounded using a deterministic ring topology. Rather than computing $O(N^2)$ all-pairs edges within a category, it calculates exactly $N$ sequential edges per category, limiting memory and rendering bottlenecks.
- The Memory page data hook sequences graph refresh requests so rapid tier, sprint, or agent filter changes cannot let an older response replace the newest memory list or embedding map. Superseded responses are discarded and only the current request may clear the loading state.

## Map Camera Behavior

The memory map uses a pointer-centered camera so users can inspect dense graphs without losing spatial context:
- Mouse wheel zoom keeps the world point under the cursor stable as closely as possible while clamping to the configured zoom range.
- The zoom controls step through the same range as the wheel with the same short camera tween, and can reach a deep-readability zoom for dense maps.
- Selecting a node from the canvas or list recenters the camera on that memory at a readable zoom level, and Reset returns to the default overview without leaving a stale selection behind.
- Node points, category labels, and memory labels are drawn in clamped screen space so the graph positions zoom while dots and text remain readable instead of growing with the map or disappearing during deep inspection.
- Hovering a node highlights it and updates the cursor only. At higher zoom levels the canvas renders the focused label bubble for the selected memory instead of creating hover-only overlays.
- The canvas render loop pauses its requestAnimationFrame and random neural-fire timer while the browser document is hidden, then resumes a single loop when the tab becomes visible again. Empty/loading maps still clear the canvas but skip the expensive edge, pulse, and node drawing passes.
- Dense maps are expected to remain navigable at 200+ memories without forcing every memory label to render at once.

## Memory Map Controls

The Memory Map control surface is driven by the currently selected project and loaded memory context:
- **Tier tabs**: Short Term, Long Term, and Skills are tab-style controls with visible counts. Short Term reads sprint-scoped memory (evidence); Long Term reads project-scoped claims; Skills reads bounded descriptors from project skill storages.
- **Sprint and agent filters**: Short Term shows the sprint selector, and every tier supports agent filtering where applicable. Skills filters to storages attached to the selected agent. When a source list is empty, the filter row shows reason copy instead of rendering a focusable empty selector.
- **Actions**: Add Memory opens the manual memory dialog for the active tier scope. Danger Delete toggles the Lobotomize delete mode; when armed, graph-node and inspector deletes are immediate while sidebar cards still require their card-level arm step. Embedding and speech models are managed under Settings -> AI Models.
- **Canvas navigation**: wheel zoom, drag pan, node click selection, Zoom in, Zoom out, and Reset view all operate on the graph camera. Reset returns to overview and clears the selected memory.
- **Sidebar list**: the memory sidebar starts collapsed as a rail with an open/close toggle. Expanded state shows search above the current alive memory list for the selected tier, sprint, and agent filters. The list supports opening a memory in the inspector, selecting visible rows, clearing selection, and confirmed batch deletion.
- **Inspector and summaries**: selecting a canvas node or sidebar row opens the inspector. The node graph, sidebar list, inspector, and category summary cards all reflect the currently loaded memories for the active tier, sprint, agent, and search context.
- **Skills mode**: skill descriptors use the deterministic fallback graph when no projection exists. Search and inspection remain available, while Add Memory, embedding-model, selection, and deletion controls are hidden because skill mutation belongs to the skill-management workflow.

## Runtime Memory Injection

All planning, worker, QA, CI/merge repair, and direct provider prompt paths use the same bounded memory-context builder. It loads a defensive recent candidate window, applies agent tier/category/strength policy, combines semantic similarity with lexical overlap, strength, and recency, removes duplicate knowledge across tiers, and emits at most eight items per tier by default. Callers provide a strict token budget (normally 1,600–1,800 estimated tokens); semantic-search failure degrades to deterministic lexical ranking instead of dropping memory context or blocking execution.

Skill retrieval uses a related hybrid strategy but keeps its own index. Each skill stores one compact descriptor embedding plus up to 64 heading-aware body chunks. Search aggregates the strongest chunk per skill, blends it with lexical name/description/tag/body overlap, filters to the requested project storage or authenticated agent attachments, and hydrates only the final bounded result set. Without a loaded embedding model, lexical ranking remains operational.

## Performance

The animated neural canvas pauses rendering while the browser tab or page is hidden and resumes when it becomes visible again. This keeps background tabs from spending work on canvas animation while preserving the loaded node graph, sidebar, inspector, and category summary state.

## Storage Requirements

Memory records encapsulate the base `content` string alongside its vectorized byte representation (`embeddingBlob`). The byte buffer must correctly decode based on its stored `embeddingDimension`. The system expects IEEE 754 32-bit floats.

Worker task runs can also write an optional `## Self Reflection Rating` section in `.task-learnings.md`. The memory capture stage stores those ratings in `task_self_reflection_ratings`, not in `memories`: one row is upserted per task run with an overall 0-5 rating, normalized per-section ratings, the source task run ID, and capture timestamps. Malformed or missing rating sections are ignored so task finalization and category memory capture continue normally.

**Note:** Knowledge subscriptions validate requested document IDs in batched chunk-safe queries (validating project ownership efficiently) before applying the replace-all transaction.

Knowledge document object access is project-scoped. Document read, delete, re-embed, and project-import operations must prove the document belongs to the route or request project before returning content or mutating rows. Legacy unscoped document endpoints require an explicit `projectId` value and treat missing documents and cross-project mismatches as the same not-found response.

## Persistent Skills vs Memory

Persistent skills are reusable agent instructions, not observations learned during sprint execution. They live in project-owned `skill_storages`, are attached to agent presets through `agent_skill_storage_bindings`, and never write markdown files into the project workspace or `.code-ux/` sprint directories.

Persistent skills also remain distinct from knowledge documents and general MCP access. For an opted-in agent with at least one attached storage, supported provider-routed and direct worker-inbox invocations receive exactly one persistent-skill prompt context, retrieval limited to that agent's project-scoped attachments, and isolated storage mounts. Disabled agents, agents without attachments, cross-project preset mismatches, and invocations without a scoped agent receive none of that persistent-skill context or access. The retrieval-only `search_skills` grant does not by itself enable the broader Code UX MCP management surface.

Skill markdown import uses frontmatter fields for `title`, `description`, `tags`, `appliesTo`, and `version`; the body is stored as the authoritative instruction content. Rendering a skill back to markdown reconstructs that metadata from the database and emits the stored body unchanged except for trailing whitespace normalization.

Skill search uses the same local embedding infrastructure as memory search but reads from `skill_embeddings`. Ordinary skill CRUD does not require an embedding provider: when no model is loaded, skills remain persisted and unembedded. When a provider is available, `SkillService` embeds the rendered skill markdown and stores the model id, vector dimension, chunk index, content hash, and blob. Search loads at most 10,000 candidate vectors from the requested storage set, skips candidates whose stored dimension differs from the query vector, ranks by cosine similarity, and breaks ties by skill id for deterministic top-K results.

## Long-Term Claims and Evidence

Sprint-scoped memories are treated as observations. Durable project knowledge is stored as canonical claims:

- `memory_claims` stores the distilled long-term claim, category, confidence, durability, status, tags, applicable paths, and source metadata.
- `memory_claim_evidence` links the claim to the sprint memories that support it.
- A project-scope memory is still created for every new claim so existing semantic memory search can retrieve the claim without a separate search path.

Active claims use a normalized fingerprint. If a later sprint produces the same durable claim, remediation links the new sprint memories as evidence on the existing claim instead of creating another long-term memory copy.

Internal MCP can also create and maintain durable claims directly through `manage_memory` without requiring a sprint ID. The canonical schema and required fields live in [MCP Tools and Contracts](../mcp/tools-and-contracts.md#manage_memory-claim-actions). The `create_claim` action writes the canonical claim row and a project-scoped mirror memory tagged with `source.originType = "memory_claim"` and `source.originId = <claimId>`, which lets `MemoryService.searchClaims` hydrate active claims from normal project memory search results. `update_claim` keeps those mirror memories aligned with the current claim text, category, confidence, and durability.

Project managers can use `list_claims`, `get_claim`, `update_claim`, and `add_claim_evidence` without approval. Destructive claim lifecycle actions use explicit approval: `deprecate_claim` returns `approvalRequired: true` until the caller repeats the same request with `approval.confirmed: true`, and it only reports success when the repository changes the claim status.

Example direct durable claim:

```json
{
  "action": "create_claim",
  "projectId": "project-123",
  "claim": "Keep provider routing decisions in project settings.",
  "category": "architecture",
  "confidence": 0.86,
  "durability": 0.9,
  "tags": ["providers"],
  "appliesToPaths": ["src/services"]
}
```

Claims can be audited through read-only endpoints:

```http
GET /api/projects/:projectId/memory-claims?status=active&category=patterns&limit=50
GET /api/memory-claims/:claimId/evidence
POST /api/projects/:projectId/memory-claims/search
```

See [Memory Claims and Evidence](../architecture/memory-claims.md) for the architecture contract.

## Post-Sprint Remediation

When a sprint completes, Code UX can run memory remediation according to `memory.remediationMode`:
- `off`: no post-sprint curation.
- `deterministic`: uses promotion scoring and promotes qualifying sprint evidence clusters up to `memory.remediationMaxPromotions`.
- `ai`: first builds promotion candidates, then invokes the provider routed through the `remediation` invocation route. The AI may select which compact candidate IDs to promote; if the AI invocation fails, deterministic claim promotion is used as a fallback.

The remediation guardrail job type is `remediation`, so runaway review loops are capped by the same guardrail system as planning, CI fix, and merge-conflict repair.

Promotion analysis treats short-term sprint memories as evidence, not as durable knowledge by default:
- sprint memories below strength `0.45` are ignored
- semantically similar memories from the same sprint are clustered into one promotion candidate with one selectable `id` plus `evidenceCount`; full source evidence IDs stay internal for claim provenance
- recurrence across previous sprints and agreement across agents can raise the candidate score
- near-duplicates of existing project-scope memories are skipped
- risk flags such as `test_fixture`, `task_local`, `file_specific`, `implementation_trivia`, `speculative`, and `ci_failure` reduce the score before the promotion threshold is applied
- the default promotion threshold is `0.5`; AI remediation uses a lower review floor of `0.45` so the model has a useful candidate set to curate without automatically promoting every reviewed memory
- AI remediation receives the cluster claim, score, reason, risk flags, evidence count, and cross-sprint count so repeated smoke-test or fixture mechanics are visible as risky evidence rather than durable project knowledge
- selected candidates become long-term claims with evidence links; raw sprint notes are not copied verbatim unless the claim itself is already the durable statement

CI-failure learnings are treated specially:
- CI/check/build failures are not automatically written into short-term sprint memory from the CI merge gate or worker learnings ingestion.
- CI-looking memories that are manually captured or imported are excluded from promotion analysis even if their text would otherwise score highly.
- AI remediation records a completed `remediation` execution invocation even when no candidates are eligible for provider review, so scheduled and post-sprint remediation attempts remain visible in the invocation history.

## Long-Term Remediation

The Scheduler page can run project-scoped long-term memory remediation. Deterministic cleanup removes:
- project-scope memories tagged as CI-failure learnings
- exact duplicate project memories, keeping the strongest and most recently updated copy

AI mode routes cleanup candidates through the `remediation` invocation route before deletion.
If deterministic prefiltering finds no cleanup candidates, Code UX records a completed skipped `remediation` invocation instead of dispatching an empty provider request.

The Memory settings panel also manages one project-scoped scheduler entry for long-term remediation. Users can set it to Off, Every day, or Every week without leaving Settings. Entries created this way are marked as `memoryRemediationTarget.source = "memory_settings"` so manually created Scheduler page entries are not overwritten.

## Project Manager Direct Memory

The dashboard's default Project Manager has `add_long_term_memory`, a narrow direct-write MCP lane for explicit remember/learn requests and stable knowledge it judges valuable. A successful call creates a canonical long-term claim plus its searchable project-memory mirror; chat can render a `codeux:memory` confirmation widget with the exact statement, category, claim id, and mirror-memory id returned by the tool.

This does not replace the two-tier capture flow. Short-term sprint observations remain evidence, and remediation/promotion still curate that evidence into durable claims. The direct lane is for stable preferences, decisions, architecture, patterns, codebase conventions, context, and learnings that should guide future work.

Programmatic memory management is exposed via the `manage_memory` MCP tool, which provides search, list, get, create, update, delete, promote, and claim actions. Skill management uses a separate `manage_skills` MCP tool to enforce the boundary between memory and persistent agent instructions.

### MCP Mechanics and Failure States

- **Skill Boundaries**: Skills enforce a `MAX_SKILL_BODY_CHUNKS` limit (capped at 64 chunks per skill). Skill searches operate on a candidate limit of up to 10,000 records.

- **Concise Search Responses**: MCP actions like `search_skills` and `list_skills` return formatting-trimmed summaries capped at 240 characters (`summarizeMarkdown`) instead of the full body. This prevents large markdown documents from cluttering context windows.
- **Full-Content Retrieval**: Agents must explicitly invoke `get_skill` with `includeContent: true` to fetch the complete markdown text.
- **Failure States & Approval Gates**: Programmatic errors (such as "Skill not found") return standard error envelopes. Destructive actions (like `delete_storage` or `delete_skill`) enforce a confirmation gate by returning `{ approvalRequired: true }` unless explicitly called with `approval.confirmed: true`.

## UI Updates and Accessibility
- The shared model catalog now lives under Settings -> AI Models. It combines the existing embedding/custom Hugging Face browser with actionable STT and TTS downloads, scoped activation, local/API provider settings, and TTS voice selection.
- Embedding model rows distinguish active, downloaded, downloading, stale, custom, and unavailable states without using legacy violet action styling. Primary actions use Signal Jade for download and activation, stale re-embedding warnings use Ember, and destructive/error states use status red. The downloaded-model delete action is icon-only with an accessible label and is disabled while the model is active.
- Embedding catalog search covers model name, id, description, language, and license metadata. Install-state, language, and source filters can be combined, while the no-results state offers one action that restores the full catalog.
- The custom Hugging Face form stays unmounted behind an accessible **Add custom model** disclosure until the operator opens it. It accepts `owner/repo` or `https://huggingface.co/...` model/file URLs plus required ONNX path, tokenizer files, dimension, approximate size, display name, and language. Client-side validation catches malformed sources and missing tokenizer metadata before `POST /api/embedding-models/custom`, then refreshes the embedding model list after success.
- Custom license metadata is operator-asserted, not reviewed or approved by Code UX. Custom model rows label the upstream terms accordingly, and the operator must confirm commercial-use compatibility before adding the entry.
- Hugging Face source links in model rows are constructed from sanitized catalog metadata and passed through dashboard URL hygiene before opening in a new tab.
- The memory sidebar now starts collapsed by default and exposes a compact rail/tab so the graph canvas remains visible until the user explicitly expands it.
- Expanding the sidebar opens directly to the current alive memory list for the selected tier, sprint, and agent filter set, with an embedded search input above the list. Browsing all visible memories is still the default path; search is not required before the list is useful.
- Closing the sidebar clears the current search query and selected memory IDs so returning to the sidebar starts from the current visible memory list.
- `MemorySearch.tsx` provides debounced text filtering by memory text/category and keyboard-accessible clear behavior (supports clearing via `Escape` and a dedicated clear button with an explicit `<kbd>Esc</kbd>` visual affordance). Search exposes a visible typing/pending state while the debounced query is applying and uses a polite live region only for committed or cleared search changes instead of announcing every keystroke.
- Search and filter controls use `controlFeedback` for focus/pressed states, `selectionMovement` for tier movement, `inlineValidation` for danger/delete-state copy, and `asyncFeedback` for pending search status. If reduced motion resolves token durations to `0ms`, the visible pending text, selected tab state, result count, and live-region announcement remain the source of truth.
- Enhanced `MemoryList.tsx` to prominently display visible memory counts and active search text directly in the UI instead of relying solely on `sr-only` live regions, while keeping the list layout `min-w-0` and overflow-safe on narrow screens. Empty filtered results keep the `memory-panel` target available for tab/search controls and announce that no memories match the current search or filters.
- Added per-memory selection toggles and a batch action bar to the sidebar list so users can select visible memories, clear the selection, or select all currently rendered results without touching hidden records. The select-all control states the current visible scope, and batch delete copy includes the selected count and visible scope.
- Batch deletion requires an explicit confirmation dialog for every selected-delete request, including one selected memory. The delete flow is optimistic, restores any failed deletions, and reports partial failures through the memory feedback region with a retry action.
- Lobotomize mode is immediate by design for graph nodes and the inspector delete action: a single graph click deletes through the canvas deletion animation, and the inspector delete button does not open a confirmation dialog. Sidebar card deletion is less easy to trigger: each card shows persistent danger copy, must be armed first, exposes a cancel action, and only then calls the existing optimistic removal path with undo feedback.
- Selection is pruned automatically when search, tier, sprint, agent, or sidebar state changes make a memory invisible, which keeps batch actions scoped to the current visible slice of memory.
- Improved memory list accessibility and reduced motion fallbacks in `MemoryList.tsx`, utilizing `useInteractionTokens` to respect OS-level reduced motion preferences.
- Updated the memory map camera so wheel, button, and click focus interactions preserve readable navigation on dense graphs. Wheel zoom uses smoother proportional movement, and graph labels keep stable on-screen sizing during zoom so text remains readable while node positions scale.
- `MemoryFilters.tsx` implements proper tab semantics, count text, roving keyboard focus, and selected sprint/agent feedback. The header presents tier count cards, compact scope copy, Add Memory, and Danger Delete without mixing configuration controls into the graph page.
- Tier, sprint, agent, and danger delete controls expose selected or pressed state with visible status text and polite announcements. Missing source lists render reason copy instead of empty controls.
- The memory list uses the shared `listReveal`, `listReorder`, and `expansionCollapse` motion tokens for search/filter transitions. Reduced-motion users receive immediate list updates while visible result counts and live regions continue to communicate what changed.
- Graph and list selection state is mirrored in text: selected cards show an `Open` badge, the graph area includes a visible selection status, and the inspector announces when a selected memory is open. This keeps critical selection feedback available without depending on canvas animation alone.
- During background refresh or failed refreshes, the sidebar keeps the last useful memory result list visible when available, marks the region busy or stale with visible copy, and exposes retry or next-action controls instead of replacing the list with a blank panel. Stale content is only reused for the same committed search query, so a new no-match search shows the no-match recovery state rather than old matches.
- Background refresh, retry, and stale-data states use `aria-busy` on the list region, polite refreshing copy, and assertive retryable error copy while preserving the previous useful rows only when the committed query, tier, sprint, and agent filter context still match. A newly committed search or filter with no matches must render the real no-match empty state and must not reuse stale rows from another query or scope.
- The inspector stays recoverable when a previously selected memory falls out of the current result set. It opens a visible unavailable-state panel with close guidance rather than silently disappearing.
- Memory card selection, batch selection, graph selection, and inspector reveals do not rely on hover or animation. Cards expose keyboard-reachable Open and Select controls, visible Open/Selected badges, `aria-selected`, and stable inspector status copy; the inspector uses tokenized reveal/progress styling but remains fully readable when motion is disabled.
- Adding a manual memory uses explicit form validation and async feedback: invalid submits focus the content field, pending submits mark the dialog busy, failures remain in an assertive status region, and successful creates briefly confirm before restoring focus to the opener.
- Embedding model actions now surface pending, success, and error messages from the catalog so downloads, activation, deletion, and re-embedding changes are announced without relying on model-card state changes alone. Model cards keep stable action/status slots, show text progress next to progress bars, expose disabled reasons for active/download/re-embed conflicts, suppress duplicate activations while an async action is pending, and confirm local model deletion before removal. Re-embedding progress includes both completed/total text and a progressbar so `0ms` motion still communicates progress.
- Batch deletion shows selected-count and visible-scope copy, requires confirmation that names the active tier, sprint/agent scope, and committed search, marks the list busy, disables conflicting batch controls while deletion is pending, and restores focus to the list controls after the async mutation settles or the confirmation is canceled. Mutation errors remain in the feedback region with a retry action, and duplicate refresh or mutation retries are suppressed while a retry is pending.
- Danger delete mode uses explicit armed/off copy at the filter toggle, page warning, card delete controls, and inspector delete action. Graph and inspector single-memory deletes remain immediate in this mode, while sidebar cards use an arm/cancel step before deletion.
