# Sprint Imports

Sprint imports support three production paths from the Sprints page: structured markdown bundles, GitHub/GitLab issue imports, and Jira issue imports.

Internal MCP clients use the same importer services through `manage_sprints` action `import_issues`. For payload examples covering search-only imports, assigned-work searches, explicit Jira keys, explicit GitHub/GitLab issue numbers, sprint attachment, and plan-after-import flows, see [MCP Tools and Contracts: `manage_sprints import_issues`](../mcp/tools-and-contracts.md#manage_sprints-import_issues).

## Markdown Import

Use `Import -> Markdown` to create a sprint from a sprint metadata document plus an optional task bundle.

The Import flyout renders as a viewport-level overlay while open, so it remains above the sprint gallery cells and their hover controls instead of being trapped by animated page stacking contexts.

Sprint markdown supports:

```md
name: Runtime hardening
number: 12
status: idle
goal:
Stabilize the dashboard runtime, reduce noisy retries, and verify health endpoints.
```

The sprint title is optional when creating a sprint from the dashboard, MCP, quicksprint, or import flows. If the title is omitted, Code UX stores a deterministic placeholder and the Planning agent may replace it with a generated title after it returns a structured plan. A custom user-supplied title is preserved during planning and replanning.

Task bundles use file markers. Each marker becomes one task, preserving order and dependency keys:

```md
--- FILE: T01.md ---
title: Add request correlation logging
depends_on: []
is_independent: true
merged: false
prompt:
Objective: add correlation IDs across dashboard routes.

--- FILE: T02.md ---
title: Verify health endpoints
depends_on: ["T01"]
is_independent: false
merged: false
prompt:
Objective: add tests for /health and /ready behavior.
```

Supported task fields include `title`, `depends_on`, `is_independent`, `merged` / `is_merged`, `merge_indicator`, `status`, and `prompt`.

## GitHub/GitLab Issue Import

Use `Import -> GitHub Issues` or `Import -> GitLab Issues` to browse the selected project's remote backlog. Each provider has its own menu entry, and the entry opens the shared issue importer with that provider selected. The redesigned default view keeps the first screen low-noise: a provider switcher, host input, `owner/repository` input, text search, state, sort field, sort direction, bounded result limit, search action, compact summary rail, active filter summary, result list, and import footer. Labels, assignee, author, milestone, updated-date windows, and quick presets live behind the advanced filter toggle so operators can progressively refine the search only when the default browse-and-search path is too broad.

The importer result list shows the current sort, active filter chips, visible result count, selected result count, multi-select controls, `Select all visible results`, `Clear selection`, and per-card `Append Conversation` controls. Active filter chips distinguish always-visible targeting values, such as provider, host, repository, state, and limit, from filters the operator changed during the session. Selected issue summaries remain visible in the footer so operators can review the issue key, title, and conversation state before importing.

Result cards preserve the imported issue title, preview body, repository, issue key, labels, assignees, source link, and provider metadata such as authors, milestones, timestamps, and comment counts when the provider returns those fields.

The shared importer primitives provide compact provider-neutral summaries for all issue import modals. The view-model layer builds ordered filter chips, active-filter counts, default sort labels, and selected-result labels without depending on GitHub, GitLab, or Jira payload shapes. The shell supports a concise header, a compact summary rail, an optional collapsed advanced-filter region, a responsive content width, and an `aria-live` result/status slot so provider-specific modals can progressively simplify their default views without changing backend search payloads.

Importer forms can use the shared field primitives under `dashboard/src/v2/components/sprints/importer/` for text, date, number, select, multi-select wrapper, and textarea controls. These wrappers keep label typography, hints, disabled states, responsive sizing, and provider focus rings consistent with the Warm Void design system while leaving provider-specific search state in the modal.

Quick presets are available for common triage flows: open backlog, recently updated work, assigned-to-me or text-user matches, security-labeled items, quality and tech-debt items, failed-CI follow-ups, and merge-conflict follow-ups.

For local projects, the dashboard reads the repository's `remote.origin.url` from `.git/config` when available. This pre-fills the provider and `owner/repository` target for projects that were added from a local checkout instead of a Git clone URL.

Imported issues appear in the sprint composer under the Sprint Prompt field as linked issue cards. Each card shows the provider, repository or Jira project key, issue key, title, state, labels, assignees, source link, conversation-included state, and a remove control for pruning imported scope before submission. The import view includes an `Append Conversation` toggle on each issue card. When enabled, the sprint prompt receives the full issue body plus issue comments or notes; when disabled, it receives the full issue body without the conversation.

When the sprint is submitted, selected issues are persisted as linked sprint issue records and the sprint prompt receives a structured `Linked Issues` markdown section. Each imported issue is appended with source metadata, labels, assignees, author and timestamps when available, the complete issue body, and the selected conversation context. This gives the Planning agent and task agents the actual issue text instead of only a remote link.

Sprint completion PR descriptions also summarize persisted linked issues in the summary section so the final PR body references the source work being completed. Jira tickets render by their issue key and stored Jira URL, while GitHub and GitLab issues render by their issue key or number and stored issue URL. Sprints without linked issues omit that PR section entirely.

Repository issues have two import modes. `Import as linked issues` creates linked sprint issue records and appends the selected issue bodies to the sprint prompt. The special-task actions create imported sprint tasks instead: security, quality, merge-conflict, and failed-CI selections bypass planning prose and land directly on the sprint through the imported-task endpoint. The composer shows linked issues below the Sprint Prompt field and special imported tasks in a separate tray with task kind, source, priority, and removal controls so operators can review both kinds of scope before the sprint is created or updated.

Issue import uses the saved integration tokens:
- GitHub: system/project effective `git.githubToken`, usually configured in Settings -> Integrations.
- GitLab: system/project effective `git.gitlabToken`, usually configured in Settings -> Integrations or seeded from `GITLAB_TOKEN` / `GLAB_TOKEN` host hints.

When the GitHub token is empty, GitHub issue search, issue context loading, and auto-close fail with a token-required error. Code UX does not fall back to local `gh` or `glab` CLI authentication for dashboard or MCP importer workflows; Docker auth-copy mount settings help worker containers, but issue search, explicit import, linked sprint attachment, planning imports, and close operations need saved GitHub/GitLab tokens.

## Jira Issue Import

Use `Import -> Jira Issues` to search Jira with guided filters, multi-select issues, and attach them to the sprint composer. The Jira modal opens on the common search path first: project key, exact issue key lookup, free-text search, status, sort field, sort direction, and a bounded result limit. The default view calls out the normal open-issues, recently-updated-first behavior, active filter summary, visible result count, selected linked count, selected special-task count, and selected issue cards with their current mode.

Advanced Jira filters are grouped behind an `Advanced Jira filters` toggle. People filters hold assignee and reporter text, classification filters hold issue type, priority, and labels, the updated window uses date inputs, and the explicit JQL override uses a textarea. Project and issue-key inputs are normalized to uppercase, labels use the shared multi-select control, and the advanced JQL override remains optional. When JQL is present, it replaces the guided Jira filters for search construction.

Jira results use compact selectable issue cards with source links, Jira-specific metadata, a visible per-card import mode label, `Select all visible`, `Clear selection`, bulk conversation selection, and per-card `Append Conversation` toggles. Selected Jira issues default to linked sprint context and show `Linked issue` until the operator changes mode. When special task creation is available, operators can explicitly switch the selected Jira issues to security or quality task mode before importing.

The assignee field accepts a Jira user full name, email address, or account ID. It also accepts `me` / `currentUser()` for the connected Jira account and `unassigned` / `empty` for issues without an assignee. The server builds the Jira query from the selected filters, defaults to open issues sorted by recent updates, and uses `Settings -> Integrations -> Jira -> Default project` to prefill the project key when available. Clearing the project key browses all Jira issues the saved credentials can see.

The search endpoint also honors an exact issue key, user text, issue type, priority, labels, updated-date windows, sort field, sort direction, and a bounded result limit. Jira import requests use the same trimming, label deduplication, malformed-limit rejection, and pre-client result-limit clamp as repository issue search. Advanced users can open the JQL override and replace the guided query entirely; when JQL is present, it overrides the other filters.

Jira uses system-scoped settings from `Settings -> Integrations -> Jira`:
- site URL, for example `https://company.atlassian.net`
- account email for Jira Cloud basic auth
- API token
- default project key
- close transition name, defaulting to `Done`
- Jira-specific auto-close toggle

Jira dashboard and MCP importer workflows require those saved Jira settings. They do not use browser sessions, Atlassian CLI state, or local git configuration as an authentication fallback.

Selected Jira issues are loaded through the same prompt-context path as GitHub/GitLab imports. The sprint prompt receives the Jira description and, when `Append Conversation` is enabled, Jira comments. Imported Jira cards are persisted as linked sprint issues with provider `jira`, host extracted from the Jira URL, project key, repository fallback, parsed issue number from keys such as `OPS-42`, issue key, labels, assignees, status, source URL, and the selected conversation flag. The import result cards also surface Jira issue type, priority, reporter, assignee, labels, status, updated timestamps, and a description preview when Jira returns those fields.

When operators mark selected Jira issues as security or quality task mode, the dashboard emits imported task payloads instead of linked issue contexts. Those special tasks are created directly on the sprint and bypass planning prose, while ordinary Jira issues still become linked issues that feed the sprint prompt and linked issue records. Jira issue labels, issue type, priority, title, or description text do not automatically convert an issue into a special task.

The Jira import modal keeps each selected card's stored mode choice across result refreshes and uses that saved mode at import time, so a task that was marked special does not drift back to linked just because the search results were refreshed.

## Auto-Close

`Settings -> Sprint -> Git Flow -> Auto-close linked issues` controls whether imported GitHub/GitLab issues are closed automatically. `Settings -> Integrations -> Jira -> Auto-close Jira issues` separately controls Jira transitions.

When enabled, the sprint loop closes linked issues only after the sprint reaches terminal completion and the main merge gate is no longer blocking. GitHub and GitLab issues are closed through their configured host APIs using saved tokens; Jira issues are moved through the configured transition using saved Jira settings. Closing failures are recorded per issue and surfaced in the sprint completion report without hiding the sprint result.
