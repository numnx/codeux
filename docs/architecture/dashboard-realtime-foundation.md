# Dashboard Realtime Foundation

## Status
Implemented foundation

## Purpose

Code UX now has the first shipped dashboard realtime transport layer.

This foundation improves browser freshness for:

- project collection and selected-project changes
- sprint and task list invalidation for the selected project
- selected-project execution state
- sprint run and dispatch status changes
- live project connection state through the execution snapshot
- cross-project overview telemetry
- chat thread assignment and thread message flow

It does not replace:

- sqlite as the source of truth
- REST snapshot and mutation endpoints
- MCP `listen` for stdio clients and workers

## What Shipped

### Durable realtime event log

Code UX now persists dashboard realtime events in:

- `dashboard_realtime_events`

This creates sequence-backed replay for reconnecting browser clients.

Production refinement shipped on March 15, 2026:

- large snapshot events such as `project.live.updated`, `project.execution.updated`, `project.runtime_status.updated`, `projects.updated`, `project.structure.updated`, and `overview.telemetry.updated` now persist as lightweight sequence markers with `is_replayable = 0`
- reconnecting websocket clients still get correct gap detection, but missed heavy snapshots now trigger `snapshot_required` instead of replaying bulky payloads from sqlite
- replay decisions are now scope-aware instead of comparing against the global event sequence, which avoids false snapshot reloads when unrelated projects are active

### Coalescing realtime publisher

Code UX now coalesces runtime writes before broadcasting them.

The internal architecture uses a single unified `buildPublishTask` helper for all these endpoints, which handles caching, deduplication, payload fingerprinting, logging, and throttle semantics.

The current publisher schedules:

- `project.live.updated`
- `project.git.updated`
- `projects.updated`
- `project.structure.updated`
- `project.execution.updated`
- `project.runtime_status.updated`
- `overview.telemetry.updated`

This avoids emitting one websocket message for every low-level DB mutation while still keeping the dashboard near realtime.

Coalescing rules:

- Snapshot refreshes are coalesced by scope before the debounce flush. Repeated schedules for the same project and event type collapse into one pending publish.
- `projects.updated` and `overview.telemetry.updated` are represented as boolean pending flags, so a burst can schedule at most one publish for each surface per flush.
- Throttled snapshot publishes are requeued for the next allowed cadence instead of rebuilt immediately.
- Snapshot payloads that fingerprint the same after timestamp fields are ignored are not written or broadcast again.
- `execution_refresh` is a lightweight non-replayable invalidation event and coalesces scheduled project ids into one debounce payload.
- Replayable runtime and chat events published through `publishRawEvent` remain distinct; they are not deduplicated by the snapshot coalescer.

Failure handling guarantees:

- A failed realtime event append is logged as `dashboard_realtime_event_write_failed` with event type, scope, project id, and correlation id when present. The failure increments the event type's failure metric and does not crash unrelated scheduled publishes.
- A throwing in-process realtime listener is logged with sequence, scope, project id, and correlation id, then delivery continues for remaining listeners.
- A websocket socket write failure is logged as `dashboard_realtime_websocket_broadcast_failed` with the event context and client id. The failed socket is destroyed and removed without interrupting other subscribed sockets.
- Provider streaming activity writes are buffered by `ActivityWriteCoalescer`; failed activity batch writes are best-effort, logged with session id and batch size, and never abort the provider run.

Production refinement shipped on March 15, 2026:

- project execution snapshots are now throttled per project instead of being rebuilt on every task-run event burst
- runtime-status, structure, projects, and overview snapshots each have their own cadence limits
- project execution refresh no longer implies a `projects.updated` snapshot by default, which removes a major source of redundant dashboard work during active sprints
- snapshot-based events (`project.live.updated`, `project.execution.updated`, `project.runtime_status.updated`, `project.git.updated`, `projects.updated`, and `overview.telemetry.updated`) are fingerprinted through the shared payload helper; publications and sequence increments are skipped if the semantic payload (ignoring fetch timestamps like `updatedAt` and `timestamp`) is unchanged

July 4, 2026 refinement:

- `project.live.updated` and `project.execution.updated` use a two-tier deduplication strategy. Known live/execution snapshot shapes first build a lightweight semantic signature from stable summary fields instead of serializing the full payload.
- The live snapshot signature includes project id, selected sprint id, runtime status identity, execution identity, git status summary, and git error state. Runtime status identity includes project/sprint ids, sprint number, repository/branch fields, subtask count, and subtask ids/status/session/provider/merge/intervention markers while ignoring fetch timestamps.
- The execution snapshot signature includes project id/name, collection lengths, sprint run ids/statuses/heartbeat/lease/finish/intervention markers, dispatch ids/statuses/task run/provider/session/branch/PR/heartbeat/lease/error markers, connection ids/statuses/heartbeat/counts, assigned worker ids/statuses, attention item ids/types/severity/owner/status/claim/resolve markers, runtime event tail identities, and recent invocation tail identities.
- The optimized path still ignores volatile `updatedAt` and status `timestamp` churn, so timestamp-only reassembly does not broadcast or append a non-replayable marker. Meaningful sprint run, dispatch, attention, runtime event, or invocation changes still publish.
- Unknown payload shapes, and known event types whose snapshot shape is incomplete, still fall back to the existing normalized full-payload fingerprint. Replayable raw events published through `publishRawEvent` are unchanged and are not deduplicated by snapshot signatures.

July 5, 2026 helper contract:

- Dashboard realtime payload fingerprinting is available as a standalone backend helper in `src/services/dashboard-realtime-payload-fingerprint.ts`. The helper has no Express, WebSocket, repository, or persistence dependency, so realtime publishing code can consume it without coupling deduplication logic to transport concerns.
- The helper covers the common snapshot events (`project.live.updated`, `project.execution.updated`, `project.runtime_status.updated`, `projects.updated`, `project.git.updated`, and `overview.telemetry.updated`) using stable high-signal fields. Unknown payloads use deterministic key-sorted fallback serialization that omits fetch timestamps and bounds depth, array length, object keys, and string length so unusually large feeds cannot dominate the realtime flush cycle.

### Dashboard websocket endpoint

The dashboard server now exposes:

- `GET /api/realtime`

The protocol is intentionally small:

- browser opens websocket
- browser sends `set_subscriptions`
- server replays events after `lastSequence`
- server pushes new events as they are committed

Current subscription scopes:

- `projects`
- `overview`
- `project:<projectId>`
- `project:<projectId>:live`
- `project:<projectId>:git`
- `thread:<threadId>`

Reconnect behavior:

- replay uses only replayable events for the subscribed scopes
- if a client missed a non-replayable live snapshot or the replay window is incomplete for that scope, the server returns `snapshot_required`
- the browser then falls back to the REST snapshot for that surface

### Websocket-first dashboard consumers

The first dashboard consumers now use websocket-first updates, driven centrally by the `useRealtimeResource` foundation hook (`dashboard/src/hooks/use-realtime-resource.ts`), which handles snapshot stabilization, REST hydration, and connection degradation natively.

Active integrations include:

- `dashboard/src/hooks/use-dashboard-runtime-data.ts`
- `dashboard/src/hooks/use-overview-telemetry.ts`
- `dashboard/src/hooks/useExecutions.ts`
- `dashboard/src/hooks/useSprints.ts`
- `dashboard/src/v2/context/project-data.tsx`
- `dashboard/src/v2/ChatPage.tsx`
- Chat subscriptions now also react to `conversation.thread.deleted`, so thread removal propagates across open dashboard tabs without a manual refresh.

Behavior:

- initial snapshot still comes from REST
- the v2 Live page now hydrates from one combined `/api/live` snapshot
- after hydration, the v2 Live page treats `project.live.updated` as the only authoritative websocket payload for selected-project runtime state
- websocket updates replace stale wait time for execution and overview telemetry
- project collection and selected-project context now refresh over websocket too
- sprint and task pages now react to project-structure invalidation events
- sprint and task hooks now treat realtime invalidation as silent background refresh, which avoids foreground loading flicker while the browser is already showing current data
- execution snapshot consumers now diff snapshots semantically instead of treating every fetch-time `updatedAt` stamp as a meaningful change
- git status is now kept off the hot `/api/live` contract and streams only on the `project:<projectId>:git` sub-scope, so base project pages do not parse large Git/CI payloads they ignore
- reconnect recovery for the Live page now means re-fetching `/api/live` on `snapshot_required`, not running parallel status/execution repair logic in the browser
- polling remains a recovery tool for other websocket-backed dashboard surfaces, but the Live page no longer keeps its own steady-state poll loop

### Client live snapshot cache scope

The browser keeps a small LRU cache for `/api/live` snapshots to make project and page transitions feel immediate. The cache is scoped by project and, when known, by the selected sprint identity carried in the live snapshot or supplied by the caller. A project-only lookup is still allowed when no sprint scope is known, so initial Live page hydration can reuse a matching recent snapshot without adding a new backend request path.

When a dashboard surface knows the active selected sprint, it must request cached live data with that sprint scope. `useDashboardRuntimeData` rejects any cached or freshly fetched snapshot whose embedded project id or selected sprint id conflicts with the active runtime scope, falling back to an empty scoped snapshot until REST or websocket hydration provides matching data.

Sprint selection changes invalidate every cached `/api/live` entry for that project. This keeps Live and Tasks pages from rendering a previous selected sprint's payload after `useSprints().selectSprint` updates the project selection, while preserving direct websocket replacement from `project.live.updated` for steady-state updates.

## Current Backend Integration Points

Realtime refresh scheduling is currently wired from:

- `src/repositories/execution-repository.ts`
- `src/repositories/connection-chat-repository.ts`
- `src/repositories/project-attention-repository.ts`

That means the browser is refreshed when execution state or live connection state changes in the DB-native runtime path.

The publisher intentionally ignores heartbeat-only execution writes where possible to avoid noisy event spam.

Additional March 15, 2026 tuning:

- noisy task-run updates and task-run event appends no longer force overview telemetry refresh on every mutation
- lease updates still refresh the project execution surface, but they no longer churn overview telemetry
- attention queue open/claim/resolve mutations now notify the live execution snapshot directly instead of waiting for a nearby side-effect refresh

April 29, 2026 refinement:

- `ExecutionRepository` now coalesces burst `scheduleProjectExecutionRefresh` notifications per project into a single next-tick dispatch before handing off to `DashboardRealtimeService`
- coalescing preserves escalation semantics: if any write in the burst requests `includeOverview`, the flushed notification for that project includes `includeOverview: true`
- refreshes remain isolated per project, so burst activity in one project does not suppress another project's refresh

Production refinement shipped on March 15, 2026:

- project execution, runtime-status, and structure refresh scheduling now also fan into `project.live.updated`, so the Live page always receives a fresh combined snapshot after any committed runtime mutation
- the server now performs a periodic background live-snapshot refresh for the selected project so git status and other slower-changing runtime metadata continue to stream even when no new task event is being written
- large live and git snapshot publishers check websocket subscription demand before running their loaders, so task churn does not assemble or serialize heavy frames when no tab is subscribed to `project:<projectId>:live` or `project:<projectId>:git`

## What This Improves

Compared with pure polling, the dashboard now updates much faster for:

- sprint start
- sprint pause
- sprint cancel
- project list and project selection freshness
- sprint/task structure changes across open dashboard tabs
- dispatch queue and run-state changes
- overview telemetry activation and deactivation
- live connection state changes inside the selected-project execution snapshot
- chat thread assignment, thread creation, and message arrival

This reduces the visible lag that previously made sprint cards and live panels feel stale.

## What Is Not Realtime Yet

This is the first slice, not the final transport rollout.

Still pending:


- broader polling reduction for non-Live dashboard surfaces once websocket behavior has been hardened longer

## Relationship To MCP Listen

The MCP listener model is unchanged.

Code UX still uses:

- blocking `listen`
- one actionable item at a time
- explicit continuation guidance for stdio clients and workers

WebSockets are browser transport only.



### Client Lifecycle and Resource Management

The dashboard realtime client operates as a shared singleton to multiplex multiple React hooks and components over a single underlying WebSocket connection.

To prevent memory leaks across long-lived dashboard sessions or during test execution:
- The `online` event listener is stored as an instance field and properly removed when the client is disposed.
- The shared singleton exposes a `resetSharedDashboardRealtimeClientForTest` export specifically to tear down and recreate the client between test cases, guaranteeing no cross-test pollution from timers or stray event handlers.
- When the final active subscription is removed, the client schedules exactly one disconnect check. If no new subscriptions arrive during the debounce window, it explicitly clears its sync timers, reconnect timers, and any stale state (such as the `lastSentScopesKey`) before closing the socket.
- Subscription dispatch loops are guarded to ensure that a listener removed mid-dispatch does not receive subsequent messages in the same frame.

## Degraded Mode and UI Reflection

The frontend now drives a deterministic degraded UI mode based on websocket status. The transport state natively manages transitions between `connecting`, `connected`, `reconnecting`, and `disconnected`. The UI uses this state to clearly indicate degraded conditions without modifying the last-known snapshot data, preventing split-brain states when offline.

## Performance Baselines

The live dashboard transport is designed to send updates as fast as mutations occur, making payload size and assembly speed critical to scalability.

To measure current latency and payload sizes against a representative active-project fixture, run the benchmark harness:

```bash
node --loader ts-node/esm scripts/measure-live-snapshot.ts
```

This harness tracks:
- Average build time
- Size contribution by module (Project Management, Runtime Status, Execution State, Git Tracking)
- Realtime background publisher publish cadence

Any future optimization work involving `/api/live` should test regressions or improvements against this harness first.
