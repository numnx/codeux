# Agent Sync And Planning Agent

## Status
Implemented

## Purpose

Code UX now treats dashboard agents as database-backed records that can be seeded and refreshed from markdown files under:

- `<project>/.code-ux/agents/*.md`
- `~/.code-ux/agents/*.md`

When the packaged default assets are present, Code UX also seeds missing base agent files into `~/.code-ux/agents` before scanning. Existing user files are preserved, so local customizations remain the higher-priority home defaults. Built-in default agent seeding is one-shot per project: after the defaults have been imported once, Code UX records `default_agent_presets_copied_<projectId>` in the application database and does not copy or re-import those built-in defaults again for that project. Deleting a built-in default agent is therefore respected on later syncs.

The built-in roles are now:

- `Planning agent`
- `Project Setup Agent`
- `Project manager`
- `Quality assurance agent`
- `Worker`

These agents are used as follows:

- `Planning agent`
  - improve a sprint prompt before creation
  - plan sprint subtasks after creation
  - optionally start the sprint immediately after planning
- `Project Setup Agent`
  - research a newly added or existing repository
  - generate repository-specific specialist agents and coding-agent routing
  - generate project quicksprint templates, preview startup script content, and basic GitHub/GitLab CI artifacts
- `Worker`
  - provide the editable execution prompt for background CLI task runs
  - provide the editable reply prompt for connected worker/listener inbox responses
- `Project manager`
  - provide the editable instruction source for worker-routed clarification auto-answer
- `Quality assurance agent`
  - review completed tasks and sprint completion with full sprint context
  - continue existing Jules or CLI task sessions with concrete fix instructions when QA requests changes

## Source Of Truth

Agents are stored in sqlite and edited from the dashboard. SQLite is the live authority used by routing, planning, execution, chat, and the Agents dashboard. Markdown files are a project-reviewable import/export surface, not the runtime source of truth while Code UX is running.

SQLite remains the live authority, but projects can also mirror dashboard edits into project-local markdown under:

- `<project>/.code-ux/agents/*.md`

That mirror is controlled by the project setting:

- `agents.saveToProjectDirectory` (default `true`)

That means:

- newly discovered markdown agents are imported into sqlite automatically
- existing DB agents remain editable in the dashboard
- when project markdown mirroring is enabled, dashboard create/update writes the agent body into a project-local markdown file
- mirrored project files use a filesystem-safe slug format such as `planning_agent.md`
- editing a default or home-backed agent from the dashboard creates a project-local override file instead of modifying the default/home source
- if the linked markdown file later differs from the DB copy (including changes to memory settings, avatar config, or provider/model preferences), the agent is marked `out_of_sync`
- the dashboard can re-import one linked agent or use **Pull from files** to explicitly copy project markdown into sqlite on demand
- the dashboard can use **Push to files** to export sqlite-backed agents into project-local `.code-ux/agents/*.md` files when sqlite should win over file drift
- the dashboard can use an individual agent's **Push to file** action to export only that sqlite preset to the selected project's `.code-ux/agents/` directory
- the dashboard can push `.code-ux/agents/*.md` back into git, either as a local commit, a commit plus branch push, or a feature-branch pull request into the default branch
- when opening a pull request, Code UX resolves the effective dashboard GitHub/GitLab host tokens and forwards them to the PR service so repository-host authentication stays aligned with the current project settings

## Bundled Base Instruction Revisions

Only `Planning agent` and `Project manager` participate in bundled base-instruction revision tracking. Worker, Quality assurance agent, and Project Setup Agent continue through normal agent discovery and synchronization; they do not receive this automatic compatibility-update behavior. The two supported roles track their bundled revisions independently from each other and from the normal project/default/home source winner. Revisions are SHA-256 hashes of normalized instruction content, so an update is detected even when filesystem timestamps are unchanged.

Each preset can persist role-keyed `base_instruction_state_json` with the baseline content hash, whether the instructions have diverged, and the last bundled revision applied. A legacy record is initialized as untouched only when both its sqlite instructions and selected markdown source match the current bundle; an ambiguous legacy difference is treated as customized.

The role targets are resolved independently: `agents.routing.planning.agentPresetId` selects the Planning target, and `agents.routing.dashboardReply.agentPresetId` selects the Project manager/dashboard-reply target. A null route falls back to the correspondingly named built-in. When that built-in is still selected and its tracked instructions are untouched, discovery applies a newer bundle automatically and updates only its instruction markdown. Avatar, description, labels, provider/model selection, container mode, memory settings, MCP access, skill bindings, source metadata, and routing settings are preserved. A linked project markdown mirror receives the same instruction-only update.

Dashboard edits, sqlite-only edits, and project markdown edits that diverge from the tracked baseline mark the role customized and are never replaced by background synchronization. Project markdown edits continue to import through the existing source-sync path. If either route selects another preset, automatic application is skipped for that routed behavior. Notice discovery identifies the actual routed target with `selectedAgentPresetId` and `selectedAgentName`, and reports either `customized_instructions` or `alternate_route`.

The Agents page discovers notices with `GET /api/projects/:projectId/agent-presets/base-updates`. The GET performs normal agent synchronization, which may auto-apply an untouched built-in update, but it does not invoke a provider. Its response contains only the remaining notices that need an explicit merge. `POST /api/projects/:projectId/agent-presets/base-updates/:baseAgentRole/apply` accepts only `planning_agent` or `project_manager`, requires an existing notice, and invokes the configured local planning-provider route with execution type `agent_base_update`.

The provider compares the previous base, current bundle, and selected preset. Its prompt requests raw JSON with one non-empty `instructionMarkdown` property, while the server parser also accepts supported presentation noise such as surrounding text, markdown fences, and provider response envelopes. After extraction, validation still requires a non-array JSON object containing exactly that one non-empty string property and no others. Extraction, payload-shape, and preservation failures continue through the structured corrective retry path in the same provider session. The merge prompt permits only compatibility-critical system additions, such as changed MCP usage or strict output-schema rules. Server validation requires every original selected-preset line to remain in order (using `assertPreservesSelectedInstructions`); Code UX itself writes the validated markdown through `AgentPresetSyncService`. The provider cannot update the main prompt, custom behavior, avatar, labels, routing, provider/model, memory, MCP access, persistent skills, or source metadata. Before writing, the service verifies that the selected route still points to the preset named by the notice. Malformed or destructive output, a missing or stale notice, unsupported provider selection, provider failure, or a concurrent route change leaves the preset instructions and stored bundled revision unchanged. Failed updates do not mutate the preset and allow safe retry. A successful merge advances the selected preset's tracked revision to the current bundle immediately, meaning a restart is not required, even when its compatibility-only markdown intentionally differs from the bundle, so the same notice does not recur.

## Agent Metadata

`agent_presets` now stores source metadata in addition to the editable instruction body:

- `source_path`
- `source_scope`
- `source_updated_at`
- `source_imported_at`
- `avatar_config_json` (used for dashboard UI avatars: legacy body fields plus robot chassis, eyes, antenna, headphones, accent, base, and visor colors)
- `memory_template_override_enabled`
- `memory_template_markdown`
- `base_instruction_state_json`

These metadata fields are synced bidirectionally with project markdown files using a `---json` frontmatter codec:

```markdown
---json
{
  "avatarConfig": {
    "body": "human",
    "hair": "short"
  },
  "memoryTemplateOverrideEnabled": true,
  "memoryTemplateMarkdown": "Format memory here."
}
---
Agent instructions go here.
```

The API record also exposes derived sync state:

- `manual`
- `synced`
- `out_of_sync` (triggers when name, description, markdown, avatar config, provider, model, or memory config differs between the DB and the file)
- `missing_source`

When markdown does not include `avatarConfig`, Code UX still persists a resolved avatar before writing sqlite. Built-in base roles use curated defaults, while generated or custom project agents receive a deterministic random look seeded from project, agent, and label metadata. Project Setup Agent output goes through the same resolver, so generated specialist agents get a stable avatar that is mirrored into project markdown instead of being recalculated on every dashboard load.

## Import Resolution

When Code UX pulls project agents from files:

1. missing packaged base agents are installed into `~/.code-ux/agents` without overwriting existing files only until the project-level default-agent copy flag is recorded
2. project-level `.code-ux/agents` is scanned first
3. repo-default `.code-ux/agents` from the running Code UX checkout is scanned second
4. home-level `.code-ux/agents` is scanned third
5. filename without `.md` becomes the agent name
6. project-scoped files win on name collisions
7. previously unseen agents are imported into sqlite automatically
8. `out_of_sync` records are updated in SQLite during pulling.
9. after the first default-agent import for a project, built-in default/home roles are skipped on future automatic syncs so user deletions are not recreated

When Code UX pushes project agents to files, it writes only under the selected repository's `.code-ux/agents/` directory. Manual, missing-source, out-of-sync, home-backed, and default-backed sqlite presets are exported as project-local markdown overrides, then linked back to those project files. Pushing will not overwrite a file already linked to a different agent. The push path intentionally does not import markdown drift first, because an explicit push means sqlite should overwrite the project-file representation.

## Planning Agent Flow

The Planning agent runs through the existing connected listen-mode inbox path or a virtual worker.

Behavior:

1. dashboard resolves the `Planning agent` from the DB.
2. dashboard selects an active listen-mode planning connection, preferring `worker` and then falling back to `listener`.
3. dashboard creates an execution invocation. If using a connected worker, it also opens a background, non-chat-visible thread (`scope: "connection"`) targeted at that worker.
4. dashboard posts a planning request message. It records the prompt, routing information, and any JSON-retry attempts as system/user/assistant messages in the invocation audit trail.
5. the worker (or virtual provider) processes the request and generates the reply.
6. Code UX captures the reply in the invocation, parses the payload, and applies the result. During parsing, Code UX utilizes a shared `src/services/structured-provider-response-service.ts` to execute virtual provider runs and automatically retry parsing using corrective prompts if the shape is malformed. The payload extraction leverages `src/services/planning-json-extractor.ts` to recursively search noisy, markdown-wrapped, or nested provider responses for the canonical JSON payload.

Planning route cancellation is explicit. Dashboard route handlers no longer bind sprint planning, prompt improvement, or quicksprint execution to the HTTP response close event, so refreshing or closing the browser does not terminate the provider run. The sprint composer attaches a `clientRequestId` to each planning request; `Cancel Active Request` posts that id to the planning cancellation endpoint, while `New Sprint` detaches the current composer UI, clears local busy ownership, and leaves the server-side planning run active so a fresh sprint can be composed immediately. Quicksprint execution follows the same background-safe lifetime and must not kill provider work simply because the client request is detached.

When memory is enabled, planning prompts also include:

- the planning agent's current long-term memory for the project
- the current sprint's short-term learnings for that same planning agent when a sprint scope exists
- the effective learnings-capture instruction, using the agent-specific memory template override when configured

Planning prompts also resolve `designGuidance` from the effective project settings. Selected non-`none` tech-stack and styleguide entries are injected as a compact `Project Guidance` section before the task/output instructions; `none` selections are omitted so the planner receives active guidance without copying inactive defaults into every generated task prompt.

### Planning decomposition quality

The bundled Planning agent and the universal planning prompt no longer optimize toward a fixed `3..8` task range. Task count follows repository ownership boundaries, integration seams, and risk: a localized change may need fewer than three tasks, while a broad security, persistence, distributed-runtime, or client/server sprint may need more than eight.

Before returning the strict DAG JSON, the planner builds an internal coverage inventory across the relevant contracts, schemas, migrations, producers, runtime consumers, dependency injection and registration, entrypoints, user-facing surfaces, lifecycle behavior, failure paths, tests, and documentation. The inventory is reasoning guidance rather than a new output field, so the existing `PlanningPayloadValidator` contract remains unchanged.

Plans must explicitly assign applicable authorization, validation-failure, timeout/error, retry, concurrency, idempotency, compatibility, restart/reconnect, stale-state, and cleanup behavior. A shared contract or helper is not considered complete until its required production consumers and activation paths are owned by tasks. When multiple branches must be exercised together, the planner may create a dependent fan-in integration task only when it owns executable integration/E2E coverage, test harness changes, or concrete runtime wiring; review-only and final-polish placeholders remain prohibited.

The final planning self-check maps every sprint requirement to an observable acceptance signal and asks whether an exacting sprint-completion review would still find obvious missing consumers, wiring, lifecycle handling, documentation, or integrated verification. This reduces remediation deferred to sprint QA without converting speculative risks into tasks or creating one task per file.

In Docker execution mode, planning runs against a snapshot workspace and captures `.task-learnings.md` back out of that snapshot volume so memory capture still works even though the provider never writes directly into the host repo path. In `REMOTE` git mode, fresh planning invocations refresh `origin` and resolve only the explicit sprint feature branch when present, otherwise the effective runtime git default branch. Snapshots seed from `origin/<branch>` only and never inspect the host repo's currently checked-out branch. If the remote tracking branch or fallback cannot be prepared, planning fails instead of falling back to a stale local branch. Planning restart/continue actions reuse the preserved snapshot workspace so cancelled or interrupted provider sessions can still resume.

## Project Setup Agent Flow

Project setup uses the virtual provider execution path but applies artifacts through Code UX rather than relying on provider-side file writes.

Behavior:

1. Code UX ensures a project-local `Project Setup Agent` exists.
2. When agent generation is selected, Code UX resolves the current base templates for `Project Setup Agent`, `Worker`, `Planning agent`, `Project manager`, and `Quality assurance agent` when they are available.
3. The setup prompt includes those base templates as normative source material only for agent generation, requiring generated repository-specific agents to adapt their scope discipline, workspace protocol, verification standards, DAG planning model, and QA review boundaries instead of inventing a generic role prompt from scratch.
4. When quicksprint generation is selected, Code UX injects the built-in quicksprint templates as the reusable-template quality baseline so generated project templates preserve the audit/improvement structure while adapting to repository evidence.
5. When preview-script generation is selected, Code UX injects the exact bundled `.code-ux/container/setup.sh` bootstrap script so the generated `.code-ux/browser/start-preview.sh` complements the container bootstrap instead of duplicating provider CLI or OS setup work.
6. The setup prompt includes the same selected project guidance before artifact instructions. If the styleguide remains `none`, the prompt tells the setup agent to inspect existing styling, brand assets, design tokens, components, layouts, and interaction patterns before proposing a repository-specific styleguide, even when tech-stack guidance is also `none`.
7. The setup prompt requires repository discovery across assistant instruction markdown, documentation, dependency manifests, package scripts, source layout, preview/runtime configuration, and existing CI files.
8. The provider returns strict JSON containing selected artifacts.
9. Code UX writes agents through `AgentPresetSyncService`, quicksprints through `QuicksprintService`, preview startup to `.code-ux/browser/start-preview.sh`, and CI files to the returned GitHub/GitLab paths.
10. Agent routing preserves the existing Planning agent default and updates generated worker specialists into the task-coding orchestrator roster.
11. Newly generated coding specialists that are added to the orchestrator roster are created with `code_ux` MCP enabled and the default Playwright MCP custom server (`playwright`) linked. This gives setup-generated task-coding agents the same browser automation MCP default as the built-in Worker and Project manager agents.
11. Updating an existing generated specialist preserves its current MCP access selection, including any user-edited `linkedServerIds`, instead of reapplying the default Playwright MCP link.

Generated agents keep persisted avatar metadata. Existing generated agents that predate avatar persistence receive a stable avatar the next time Project Setup Agent updates them.

The base-template handoff is fail-soft: if a user intentionally deleted a built-in default role, project setup continues with the remaining templates rather than recreating the deleted role implicitly. Template injection is conditional by artifact category, so disabling agents, quicksprints, or preview generation also omits that category's template context from the provider prompt.

The dashboard exposes this flow from project creation and from existing project cards. The HTTP endpoint is `POST /api/projects/:projectId/setup`.

### Prompt Lineage

Code UX stores the complete lineage of a sprint's evolution:

- `originalPrompt`: The raw, unrefined request from the user.
- `goal`: The improved, technically precise description generated by the Planning agent.

This allows users to refer back to their original intent even after the Planning agent has refined the scope.

### Grounded Improve Prompt

The `Improve with AI` flow now encourages the Planning agent to scan the repository before suggesting improvements. This "grounded" approach allows the agent to:

- Verify existing file paths and module structures.
- Clarify architectural patterns and symbols mentioned in the prompt.
- Propose implementation-ready scopes that are aware of the codebase reality.

### Planning Overrides

The sprint composer can provide request-scoped overrides for the planning process:

- `planningAgentPresetId`: Select a specific project agent preset to use for planning. If omitted or invalid, the system uses the project default planning preset and then falls back to the built-in `Planning agent`.
- `workerId`: Explicitly route the planning request to a specific connected MCP worker.
- `virtualModel`: Override the default virtual worker model (e.g., using a more capable model for complex planning) without changing project-wide settings.
- `agentRoutingMode`: Override task-coding agent routing for this sprint as `MANUAL` or `ORCHESTRATOR`.
- `workerAgentPresetId`: In manual routing mode, pin generated tasks for this sprint to a specific worker preset.

Project agent routing can also define a default planning preset. The sprint composer starts from that default, while a per-request `planningAgentPresetId` still wins for a single sprint. Planning presets are selected from project agent presets rather than from custom dashboard labels.

These overrides are honored by all planning-related actions, including `Improve with AI` (Plan ahead with AI), `Plan Only`, `Plan & Start`, and `Replan`. Selecting an alternate planning preset allows operators to use specialized instructions for a single sprint without changing the project's default worker routing or virtual model overrides.

### Replanning

Existing sprints can be explicitly replanned. When the `replan` flag is set, Code UX:

- Clears the existing task set and its dependencies.
- Generates a fresh DAG of tasks from the current sprint goal.
- Preserves the sprint's identity and metadata.

### Planning Contracts

The planning contract is now strictly enforced by the `PlanningPayloadValidator` during ingestion. The validator ensures that the planner emits deterministic DAG payloads without improvising formatting, and triggers automatic JSON retries with explicit error guidance if the contract is violated:

- task keys must use `T01`, `T02`, `T03`, ... in strict topological order (no gaps)
- the `tasks` array itself is the DAG order
- dependencies must only reference unique keys defined earlier in the task list (forward references and duplicate dependencies are rejected)
- every task must include `title`, `description`, `promptMarkdown`, `priority`, `executorType`, and `dependsOn`
- `priority` and `executorType` are strictly validated against allowed enum values (unsupported values are rejected rather than coerced)
- `promptMarkdown` is standardized to five sections in this exact order:
  - `## Objective`
  - `## Scope`
  - `## Implementation Requirements`
  - `## Constraints`
  - `## Verification`

This strict validation occurs before any tasks are written to the repository, ensuring that partial or malformed plans never reach the database. This keeps planning quality deterministic across providers and reduces executor ambiguity.

### Provider Throttling And Quota Recovery

Virtual planning now classifies retryable provider failures before deciding whether to fail the invocation:

- `QUOTA_EXHAUSTED` means the provider reported a real quota window, optionally with a reset time.
- `RATE_LIMITED` means the provider rejected the request transiently, including Gemini `429` no-capacity responses.

Planning follows the shared CLI workflow retry controls:

- `cliWorkflow.retryOnQuotaReset` (default `true`)
- `cliWorkflow.retryOnRateLimit` (default `true`)
- `cliWorkflow.rateLimitRetryDelaySeconds` (default `10`)
- `cliWorkflow.maxRateLimitRetries` (default `5`)

When a retryable provider error occurs, Code UX appends an explicit system event to the execution invocation, records the classified error on the invocation row, waits for the configured backoff/reset, and retries. Rate-limit retries stop after the configured max retry count, while quota-reset retries still wait for the provider's reset window. For providers that support native session continuation, each retry now resumes the prior provider session instead of starting a brand-new conversation. That makes the dashboard invocation rail and message history show:

- which error type occurred
- whether Code UX is waiting on quota reset or rate-limit backoff
- which virtual model the planning agent actually used

If `autoStart` is enabled, Code UX starts orchestration after the tasks are created unless planning self-reflection is enabled and the final reflection decision does not pass. In that case the valid planned tasks stay saved, and the operator can start the sprint manually after review.

Provider claims first use the atomic SQLite capacity boundary. Successful claims do not query Docker.
When a bounded claim is denied, stale-slot recovery joins a throttled process-wide Docker inventory;
after the invocation age/activity guards pass, a missing labelled container lets Code UX fail the
orphaned provider/execution invocation and retry the claim. This avoids a Docker reconciliation
probe for every planning request while retaining stale-slot recovery. Startup recovery also closes
stale `running` planning invocation audit rows that never linked to provider runtime or whose
provider invocation is already terminal, keeping the dashboard invocation ledger from showing
historical planning work as active.

Startup recovery also reconciles the task-coding runtime projections that sprint dashboards use to decide whether work is active. It closes stale `task_coding`, `cli_task_coding`, and `cli_task_followup` audit rows when the linked task run, provider invocation, or sprint run is already terminal; releases orphaned running `task_coding` provider rows whose task or sprint is terminal; and finalizes active task runs that no longer have dispatch/provider/execution linkage. Paused sprint-run rows are only failed automatically when the owning sprint is no longer `running`, so legitimate manual pauses remain resumable while old idle sprint runs stop appearing stuck.

## Worker Agent Flow

The Worker agent is resolved from sqlite in the same way as the Planning agent.

Behavior:

1. Code UX syncs/imports the `Worker` preset from markdown if a linked project/default/home file exists
2. task execution prompt assembly loads the `Worker` instructions from sqlite
3. when the dashboard edits `Worker`, the DB record is updated and optionally mirrored back into `<project>/.code-ux/agents/worker.md`

## Project Manager Flow

Dashboard inbox reply generation resolves the configured dashboard reply preset and defaults to the `Project manager` instructions from sqlite. New and imported projects store the unset Project manager fallback at project scope. When the dashboard edits `Project manager`, the DB record is updated and optionally mirrored back into `<project>/.code-ux/agents/project_manager.md`.

Dashboard reply execution grants the assigned Project Manager the normal reply management surface plus the restricted self-wakeup and direct long-term-memory lanes. The bundled `project_manager.md` is the comprehensive operating manual for orchestration, manual planning fallback, scheduler continuation, custom dashboards, node flows, persistent skills, rich widgets, and durable-memory judgment.

### Asynchronous MCP planning follow-through

Direct MCP `manage_sprints plan` is an asynchronous management contract. After synchronous project, sprint, and replan precondition checks, the serialized acknowledgement keeps the existing result fields and adds `planningGuidance`. The initial check time is the calculated `estimatedCompletionAt`; every later non-terminal read returns a `nextCheckAt` one minute after that read. ETA overrun is not a timeout and never changes an invocation to failed by itself. Repeating `plan` while the project/sprint request is unsettled returns the current in-progress guidance without starting another provider request or registering another terminal continuation.

The assigned Project Manager uses its restricted scheduler surface to create one non-recurring status wakeup at a time. It schedules the first for the returned ETA, schedules a subsequent check only when the refreshed guidance remains `in_progress`, and does not requeue planning, change provider/model/settings, or interpret missing tasks as failure while the contract remains non-terminal. `succeeded`, `failed`, `cancelled`, and `paused` are terminal projections: they set `nextCheckAt` to `null`, stop polling, and expose available failure evidence.

This agent-owned polling path coexists with the runtime-owned planning terminal wakeup. A dashboard-thread planning promise produces exactly one due-now, non-recurring completion or failure wakeup through the existing `agent_wakeup` delivery path. When that terminal wakeup wins the race with an ETA check, the Project Manager lists and cancels its obsolete pending planning-status wakeups for the same invocation or sprint, excluding the currently executing wakeup. Standalone MCP clients have no dashboard thread, receive no completion wakeup, and must poll sprint, task, or telemetry state according to the returned timestamps.

This replaces the old `worker.md` and `listener.md` guide-loading path.

## Instruction Templates

Sprint protocol text such as planning blockers, merge guidance, attention summaries, watch-loop headers, and cleanup output is no longer file-backed.

Those templates now live in scoped settings:

- `agents.instructionTemplates`

They are edited from:

- `Settings -> Agents`

Built-in defaults remain in code, while system and project settings can override them in sqlite.

## Dashboard Surface

### Agents page

The Agents page now shows:

- normal editable DB agent fields
- whether an agent is DB-only or markdown-backed
- out-of-sync state for changed markdown
- `Import` action for linked markdown agents
- `Pull from files` action for copying project markdown into sqlite
- `Push to files` action for exporting sqlite-backed agents to project markdown
- `Push to file` action for exporting one sqlite-backed agent to project markdown
- agent preset management only; QA execution settings live under `Settings -> Sprint & Git`

### Sprints page

The sprint creation modal now supports:

- `Improve with AI`
- `Plan & Start`
- `Plan Only`
- `Save Draft`

Both `Improve with AI` and planning actions are worker-backed via the Planning agent.

## Default Agent

This repository now includes the default built-in agent file:

- `.code-ux/agents/planning_agent.md`
- `.code-ux/agents/project_manager.md`
- `.code-ux/agents/quality_assurance_agent.md`
- `.code-ux/agents/worker.md`

These files are auto-imported when this repository is used as the selected project and no DB record exists yet.

Packaged Electron builds include these same base files as default resources. If a local checkout is not present, Code UX copies any missing files into the user's `~/.code-ux/agents` directory and imports them from there.
