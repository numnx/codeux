# Sprint Preview Browser

This page describes the sprint-scoped in-app browser and preview-container runtime.

## Goal

Code UX can now build and run one isolated preview app per sprint, then surface that app inside the dashboard through a same-origin browser view.

The feature is designed for:
- comparing multiple active sprint builds side by side without port conflicts
- previewing progress inside Code UX instead of switching out to separate terminals
- reusing the existing Docker/bootstrap/runtime stack instead of introducing a second container system

## Primary Implementation Files

- `src/services/sprint-preview-service.ts`
- `src/services/sprint-preview-utils.ts`
- `src/repositories/sprint-preview-repository.ts`
- `src/repositories/app-db-storage.ts`
- `src/server/dashboard-server.ts`
- `src/server/code-ux-server.ts`
- `dashboard/src/v2/BrowserPage.tsx`
- `dashboard/src/v2/lib/browser-api.ts`
- `dashboard/src/v2/SettingsPage.tsx`

## Runtime Model

Each preview session is scoped to one `(projectId, sprintId)` pair.

Key rules:
- every sprint preview runs from a dedicated exported branch snapshot under the preview runtime root, not a registered git worktree
- host runtime paths and in-container paths are kept separate for cross-platform Docker Desktop support: Windows/macOS/Linux host paths are mounted into the Linux container at `/code-ux-preview-runtime`, and preview `HOME`, `--workdir`, npm cache paths, and `SPRINT_PREVIEW_WORKSPACE` use POSIX container paths only
- the preview container reuses the same Docker bootstrap and can reuse an already-built cached setup image, but preview startup no longer builds setup-cache images inline or runs the full worker setup script at runtime
- the primary app inside the container listens on `sprintPreview.containerAppPort`; `sprintPreview.containerAppPorts` records that primary port first plus any additional container ports that a preview-aware worker may expose
- one preview session/container can expose multiple container-to-host port mappings, and one host-facing port is allocated from `sprintPreview.hostPortRangeStart..hostPortRangeEnd` for each configured container app port
- host ports bind to `127.0.0.1` only
- preview startup injects `HOST`, `PORT`, `DASHBOARD_HOST`, `DASHBOARD_PORT`, and `SPRINT_PREVIEW_WORKSPACE` so containerized apps can bind to the published preview port and boot from the exported snapshot directory. The primary compatibility variables still point at the first mapping, and `SPRINT_PREVIEW_CONTAINER_PORTS`, `SPRINT_PREVIEW_HOST_PORTS`, and `SPRINT_PREVIEW_PORT_MAPPINGS` expose the full routing list.
- Browser Preview settings and the Browser page right sidebar can define default preview environment variables for every container in the project scope, and each preview container card can open a modal for per-session overrides. These user variables are written through the preview Docker env-file path alongside provider env, while runtime-owned names such as `HOST`, `PORT`, `HOME`, `DASHBOARD_PORT`, `SPRINT_PREVIEW_*`, and `CODE_UX_GIT_USER_*` remain reserved.
- preview startup is serialized per `(projectId, sprintId)` so manual starts, rebuilds, and auto-start reconciliation cannot spawn duplicate session containers
- if the previewed app still binds a loopback-only internal port, the generated preview bootstrap keeps a dedicated in-container bridge open on the published preview proxy port and forwards requests to the live app listener
- containers are labeled with sprint-preview metadata so runtime reconciliation can rediscover them

Preview session state is persisted in sqlite instead of staying process-local.

## Storage

Preview runtime state is stored in the Code UX app database table:
- `sprint_preview_sessions`

The table stores:
- project/sprint identity
- preview status and health
- host/container port mapping, including the legacy primary compatibility fields `hostPort` and `containerAppPort` plus the canonical `portMappings` JSON list for all routed container ports
- container id/name
- preview workspace path and feature branch
- resolved startup mode and detected commands
- task-count and sprint-status markers used by reconciliation
- timestamps and last error state

## Startup Script Resolution

Preview startup uses a dedicated script path, separate from the task-execution setup script.

Resolution order:
1. explicit project setting `sprintPreview.startupScriptPath`
2. default project-relative path `.code-ux/browser/start-preview.sh`
3. generated fallback script when no custom preview script exists

Command detection reads `package.json` and lockfiles from the same Git ref that will be exported into the preview workspace, rather than assuming the host checkout is on the sprint branch. This keeps preview startup aligned with the sprint snapshot even when the project working tree is on `main` or another branch. It infers:
- package manager
- install command
- build command
- runtime command
- workspace app package command, when the root package only exposes broad monorepo scripts

Install behavior:
- preview runtime now uses `pnpm install --prefer-offline --no-frozen-lockfile` so non-fatal manifest/lockfile drift does not spam container logs and warmed runtime caches are reused before going back to the registry
- preview containers now reuse the shared Docker runtime package caches instead of mounting host `node_modules`, and pnpm is pinned to a persistent store under that runtime cache so exported workspaces do not trigger cold installs on every rebuild
- preview docker arguments and runtime path layouts are deterministically constructed via the helper in `sprint-preview-docker-plan.ts`
- preview fallback now prefers the base image plus app-level install/build commands over re-running the worker-oriented setup script, which avoids unrelated provider/Playwright bootstrap work from blocking app previews
- managed provider invocations select the browser runtime when `cliWorkflow.containerInstallPlaywrightBrowsers` is enabled; ordinary previews select the smaller managed base runtime
- preview scripts that run Playwright themselves should use an explicit custom browser image/script or run through the provider browser runtime rather than relying on setup-cache side effects
- before the preview container is created, Code UX repairs the per-sprint Docker volume by creating the expected workspace, `HOME`, npm cache, and pnpm store directories as root, then applying ownership and writable directory permissions so the non-root preview bootstrap can start reliably

Runtime command preference:
1. `preview`
2. `start`
3. `serve`
4. `dev`
5. static build-directory fallback via `serve`

For workspace roots, preview command detection does not treat broad root scripts such as recursive `dev` or `build` commands as the browser app by default. It scans common app package directories and prefers an app-level web server script. `dev` is only selected when the script resembles a web dev server such as Vite, Next, Astro, Nuxt, Remix, Parcel, or a similar listener, and a selected `dev` fallback skips the production build step.

The setup script configured in `cliWorkflow.containerSetupScriptPath` still prepares the container environment. It does not replace the preview startup script.

## Browser Delivery

The browser now serves each preview session on its own local origin:
- `http://preview-<sessionId>.<dashboard-host>:<dashboardPort>/...`

The dashboard server routes that host to the matching preview container by session id, generalizing beyond just `.localhost` to support tunneled or hosted environments (e.g. `preview-123.example.com`). This replaces the older path-proxy page delivery model and gives each preview its own origin by default.

Benefits:
- relative `/api/...` and websocket calls stay inside the preview container instead of hitting the main dashboard APIs
- cookies, local storage, and service workers stay isolated per preview session
- open-in-new-tab uses the preview origin directly instead of a rewritten proxy path
- extensionless direct loads such as `/sprints` now retry the preview app shell when a dev server returns `404`, so SPA routes keep working on refresh and on copied deep links
- when a preview host is not yet reachable, has been stopped, or returns a transient proxy connection failure, the preview origin serves a same-origin standby page with `Start Container` / `Rebuild Container` controls instead of surfacing raw socket errors

The dashboard injects a small preview bridge script into proxied HTML responses. The bridge:
- reports `location` and `title` changes to the parent browser page via `postMessage`
- accepts back/forward/reload/navigate commands from the parent browser chrome
- uses `history.pushState` / `history.replaceState` for parent-driven path changes before falling back to hard navigations, so SPA previews can switch routes without reloading the entire app

Host-based preview routing also proxies websocket upgrades so preview apps that derive websocket URLs from `window.location` continue to work on their own preview origin.

Preview host responses intentionally skip the dashboard origin's frame and permissions hardening headers. For proxied HTML documents, Code UX also strips upstream `Content-Security-Policy`, `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`, and `X-Frame-Options` headers before injecting the preview bridge. This keeps locally trusted sprint previews embeddable in the in-app iframe even when the previewed app ships production headers such as `frame-ancestors 'none'` or `X-Frame-Options: DENY`.

Preview hosts also apply permissive CORS at the Code UX proxy boundary. `OPTIONS` preflight requests are answered before they reach the container, proxied responses override upstream `Access-Control-*` headers, and proxied browser requests normalize `Origin`, same-preview `Referer`, and `Sec-Fetch-Site` to the loopback upstream origin before entering the container. The injected preview bridge loads before app head scripts so it can rewrite same-dashboard and any-port loopback `fetch` / `XMLHttpRequest` calls back onto the preview origin. Together, these rules prevent previewed apps from accidentally hitting the dashboard API origin or rejecting their own preview-origin requests as cross-site while they are running inside the in-app browser.

## Automation

`SprintPreviewService.reconcileSessions()` runs on a background interval from `CodeUxServer`.

It supports:
- auto-start when a sprint becomes `running`
- rebuild when completed task count increases
- rebuild when a sprint transitions into a completed terminal state
- auto-stop when a sprint becomes terminal

Rebuild behaviors:
- Preview start and rebuild now use the shared branch-sync rule. In `REMOTE` git mode, Code UX refreshes `origin` before exporting the preview workspace so remote changes (such as those pushed by hosted provider workers) are reflected in the container. In `LOCAL` git mode, preview export stays local-only.
- Preview workspace export no longer depends on a host `tar` executable. Code UX writes the Git archive on the host, then extracts it through a small Docker helper container so packaged Windows Electron builds use the same extraction path as Linux/macOS.

These behaviors are controlled through scoped settings under `sprintPreview`.

Preview environment behavior:
- scoped defaults live in `sprintPreview.environmentVariables`
- selected-container overrides live on the `sprint_preview_sessions.environment_overrides_json` row and are edited from the preview container card's Env override modal
- enabled overrides replace defaults by key; disabled override rows suppress an inherited default for that key
- values must be single-line Docker env-file values
- saved environment changes apply on the next start or rebuild because the container process receives its environment at creation time

Current preview controls include:
- `enabled`
- `showInAppBrowser`
- `autoStartOnRunningSprint`
- `rebuildOnTaskCompletion`
- `rebuildOnSprintCompletion`
- `autoStopOnTerminalSprint`
- `maxConcurrentContainers`
- `hostPortRangeStart`
- `hostPortRangeEnd`
- `containerAppPort`
- `containerAppPorts`
- `startupScriptPath`

Preview session records expose:
- `hostPort` and `containerAppPort` as primary compatibility fields for existing dashboard and API callers
- `portMappings`, an ordered list of `{ containerPort, hostPort, label?, isPrimary? }` entries

The first mapping is the primary mapping and populates the legacy fields. Existing rows without `portMappings` are read as a single primary mapping from `hostPort` and `containerAppPort`, so older sessions keep serializing with the same single-port values. Docker startup publishes every active mapping on `127.0.0.1`; the primary mapping still targets the in-container preview bridge port, while secondary mappings publish their configured container app ports directly. Preview host-origin requests and legacy path-proxy requests default to the primary mapping and may select another persisted mapping with a validated preview-port selector.

Startup hygiene:
- Docker session lifecycle management (such as `docker ps` parsing, lock acquisition for atomic container operations, container removal, and name sanitization) has been extracted to `DockerSessionLifecycle` in `src/services/docker-session-lifecycle.ts` so both preview and file-browser share identical mechanics without diverging.
- preview and file-browser runtime volumes are created explicitly with deterministic `code-ux-preview-volume-<sprintId>` / `code-ux-file-browser-volume-<sprintId>` names and Code UX labels before any container mount, so Docker does not auto-create unlabeled named volumes for these sessions
- Code UX removes existing `code-ux.preview=true` containers on server startup before the preview reconciliation loop begins, using a single batched Docker removal instead of one removal per container
- preview and file-browser orphaned volume pruning uses Docker label filters (`code-ux.preview-volume=true` and `code-ux.file-browser-volume=true`) instead of broad prefix scans over every volume on the daemon
- persisted preview sessions are reset back to `stopped` during that startup cleanup so stale containers do not survive process restarts
- **Windows Workspace Deletion**: On Windows host environments, deeply nested `node_modules` folders from package managers like `pnpm` can exceed the `MAX_PATH` limitation, causing Node's recursive `fs.rm` to hang or loop indefinitely without throwing. To ensure robust cleanup, both `SprintPreviewService` and `SprintFileBrowserService` leverage a throwaway `alpine` Docker container to perform `rm -rf` over the bind-mounted workspace directory *first*, before performing a fallback host-side recursive removal.

## Dashboard Surface

The dashboard now exposes:
- `/browser` route for the in-app browser workspace
- dock and top-nav entry points for the browser
- a dedicated horizontal session slider strip above the browser surface, so the iframe starts directly below the cards instead of sharing a stretched header row
- Browser Preview now uses the same v2 visual language as Dashboard and Tasks: a `font-display` hero heading with signal eyebrow, translucent slate/void surfaces, semantic `signal`/`ember`/`sky`/`status-*` accents, and no browser-specific beige tool chrome
- session cards in that rail are limited to persisted preview containers (`running`, `starting`, `stopped`, or `error`) rather than every sprint in the project
- the rail ends with a placeholder-style `Launch Container` card that lets the operator choose any sprint from a selector and start a preview container without changing the current sprint scope elsewhere in the dashboard
- in-app navigation no longer rebinds the iframe `src` for every route change; Browser chrome updates use the preview bridge so client-side routers can transition in place
- when the selected preview session is stopped, still warming up, or unreachable, the embedded browser continues to point at the preview origin and the server returns a same-origin standby page with `Start Container` / `Rebuild Container` actions until the container becomes reachable again
- Browser page startup now keeps non-critical side-panel requests off the initial critical path by loading preview-script contents only when the editor opens and deferring the first log fetch until after the primary browser surface has rendered
- a dedicated `Browser Preview` settings category in the left settings rail for preview enablement, visibility, rebuild policy, Git sync, and container-cap controls
- project-level `Sprint Browser` settings in the project settings editor for port range, startup script path, and automation overrides
- per-sprint startup script editing in the browser page itself
- preview logs, rebuild, stop, open, and remove actions
- Browser controls expose explicit availability and progress states: session cards, window chrome, launch controls, script saves, log refreshes, and rebuild/stop/remove actions use static status badges plus `aria-busy` / live-region text so operators can tell whether a preview is starting, running, stopped, erroring, refreshing, saving, removing, rebuilding, or launching without relying on animation alone.
- The session rail keeps overflow arrows visible on large screens when more than five previews exist, uses keyboard-reachable scroll buttons, and switches scroll behavior from smooth movement to instant movement when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is active.
- Preview cards render selected, starting, removing, health, port-routing, and unavailable-link states as text or badges. Links without a routed host port are not focusable or clickable, and removal controls stay disabled while a remove request is pending.
- The in-app browser keeps the selected session, current iframe, and last useful log output visible while background session refreshes, rebuilds, navigation commands, and log polling run. Empty or failed log refreshes mark existing logs as stale instead of replacing them with a blank panel.
- Launch, rebuild, stop, remove, script-load, script-save, session refresh, browser navigation, and browser reload actions report pending, success, stale, or error states through `ActionFeedbackRegion` or adjacent in-place status text. Duplicate launch, rebuild, stop, remove, script-save, and navigation submissions are blocked while their matching async action is pending.
- Browser chrome control names include the selected preview session and current path where it helps disambiguate the action, and disabled navigation reasons are shown visibly as well as through accessible descriptions. Session rail and top-nav session-menu updates use the dashboard motion interaction contracts (`selectionMovement` and `listReorder`) while retaining static selected/unavailable text for reduced-motion users.
- Browser navigation disabled states now distinguish between no selected session, starting containers, stopped containers, error states, missing routed host ports, and pending navigation commands. Address entry, back/forward, and reload controls use the same reason text for visible recovery guidance, tooltips, and accessible descriptions.
- Multi-port preview sessions appear as one browser window with selectable port tabs in the chrome, not as separate session rows. The primary mapping remains the default view, secondary tabs add the persisted `containerPort` selector to the preview URL, and the dashboard preserves the current path independently for each selected port.
- The Live Preview button in the Live view header opens the primary mapping on primary click. When a session has multiple port mappings, the adjacent arrow menu lists the other routed ports so an operator can open them directly; pending mappings stay disabled until a host port is available.
- Container logs expose a manual refresh action in addition to polling. Refresh failures preserve the last useful log output, mark it as stale, and report the failure without clearing the panel, so operators can retry while keeping prior runtime evidence visible.
- The top-nav Browser Sessions menu is deterministic for keyboard users: it opens only through click or explicit keyboard commands, restores trigger focus on Escape or outside close, supports Home/End and arrow roving across enabled session links, and skips disabled session rows that do not have routed preview ports.
- Preview window chrome announces open, minimized, fullscreen, closed, restored, and reopened states through stable status copy. Minimized and closed presentations keep focusable Restore/Reopen controls available, and their transitions use the shared interaction tokens with reduced-motion snapping through `motion-reduce:transition-none`.
- port routing status on preview cards, including container-port to host-port mappings such as `:4444 -> :5653`
- when `showInAppBrowser` is disabled, Browser entry points are hidden from the dashboard shell and the `/browser` route shows a configuration notice instead of the embedded workspace
- when `enabled` is disabled, preview reconciliation stops active preview containers and prevents new launches or rebuilds
- when `maxConcurrentContainers` would be exceeded, Code UX stops the oldest active previews in the same project before starting the next one

## API Surface

Preview endpoints are implemented in `src/server/dashboard-server.ts`.

- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/preview/sessions`
- `POST /api/projects/:projectId/sprints/:sprintId/preview/start`
- `POST /api/projects/:projectId/sprints/:sprintId/preview/sessions/:sessionId/rebuild`
- `POST /api/browser/sessions/:sessionId/rebuild`
- `POST /api/projects/:projectId/sprints/:sprintId/preview/sessions/:sessionId/stop`
- `POST /api/browser/sessions/:sessionId/stop`
- `DELETE /api/projects/:projectId/sprints/:sprintId/preview/sessions/:sessionId`
- `DELETE /api/browser/sessions/:sessionId`
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/sprints/:sprintId/preview/script`
- `PUT /api/projects/:projectId/sprints/:sprintId/preview/script`
- `PUT /api/projects/:projectId/sprints/:sprintId/preview/sessions/:sessionId/environment`
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/sprints/:sprintId/preview/sessions/:sessionId/logs`
- `GET /api/browser/sessions/:sessionId/logs`
- `ALL /api/browser/sessions/:sessionId/proxy/*`

The legacy path-proxy endpoint remains available for compatibility and diagnostics, but the production browser surface should prefer the preview host origin.

## Current Boundaries

Current intentional limits:
- one persisted preview session row per project+sprint pair
- preview host routing assumes projects use relative URLs or origin-derived absolute URLs for API/websocket traffic
- script detection prefers production-style preview/start/serve commands before using `dev`

## File Browser Limits and Policy

To harden against large repository scans, the file browser implements several limits:
- **MAX_TREE_ENTRIES (20,000):** Limits the number of file nodes returned by the `getTree` operation.
- **MAX_FILE_BYTES (2MB):** Caps the maximum size of a file read by `readFile` or diff generation.
- **Pruned Directories:** Directories like `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build` are pruned at scan time to prevent unbounded tree generation and expensive reads.
