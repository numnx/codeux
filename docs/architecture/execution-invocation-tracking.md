# Execution Invocation Tracking

## Overview

The `ExecutionRepository` manages `execution_invocations` and `execution_invocation_messages`, a first-class model for tracking context, prompt flows, tool calls, and LLM responses. This architecture provides robust observability, historical context per sprint, and dashboard tracing capabilities without tying invocation solely to single provider usage records.

## Key Structures

### `execution_invocations`
This table represents the high-level LLM request or agent session. It holds metadata such as provider, model, status, and associated task context (if any). It can also point back to native token reporting in `provider_invocations` via `provider_invocation_id`. It keeps a rolled up `message_count` and `last_message_at` for sorting dashboard displays.

Execution invocations span various purposes:
- **Coding & Virtual Planning**: Core orchestration loops.
- **Clarification**: Prompt rewrites or operator clarification flows.
- **QA Coverage**: Automated verification and quality assurance sweeps.
- **Node Flows**: Repeatable node-flow runs and externally observable node steps.

Failed invocations can be explicitly preserved with `preserved_at`. Preservation is used for high-value transcripts such as quota-expensive planning runs that should remain available for operator review. Preserved sprint-scoped invocation rows block sprint deletion through the repository boundary so their transcripts are not removed by a foreign-key cascade.

For supported models, tracking relies on provider-reported usage. For Jules integrations, we compute **estimated** tokens by accumulating input and output characters divided by 4 (the characters-per-token heuristic), keeping it accounted for without inventing authoritative native counts.

### `execution_invocation_messages`
This table records each granular interaction loop in an invocation, preserving the exact sequence of `system`, `user`, `assistant`, and `tool` messages. It persists markdown content and parsed JSON arguments for tool calls, serving as a replayable log of an agent's reasoning process.

Provider log parsers emit normalized turns in the shared `ParsedConversationTurn` shape. Visible reasoning is represented as `ParsedConversationTurn.kind === "reasoning"` when the provider exposes readable structured transcript data; encrypted, opaque, or summary-free reasoning is not invented from final text alone. Providers may still contribute reasoning token counts to telemetry even when no readable reasoning text exists.

Before being written to the database, provider-specific conversation turns are normalized and mapped into a standard message format within `src/services/provider-conversation-message-mapper.ts`. User turns are persisted verbatim and are not storage-truncated, so long planning prompts remain auditable from the invocation transcript. Reasoning turns remain `role: "assistant"` messages and are distinguished only by `metadata.kind === "reasoning"`, so the existing database schema does not need to change.

During live telemetry, `ProviderExecutionService` rewrites invocation messages from parsed provider conversation turns for every provider-backed invocation type that carries an agent transcript. That includes planning, QA review, dashboard/chat replies, CI repair, merge-conflict repair, memory remediation, setup, and task coding. The rewrite signature is derived from the persisted message payloads so changes in reasoning text, tool arguments, tool output, or metadata trigger a refresh even when the transcript length does not change. When a provider only exposes final text, the service falls back to appending the sanitized assistant text instead of replacing earlier retry/history messages.

Provider telemetry uses the richest data the provider actually exposes. Readable reasoning is captured only when the structured parser can reconstruct it; if a provider exposes only token-level reasoning counts or opaque encrypted reasoning, the invocation keeps the token telemetry but does not fabricate a transcript turn.

CLI provider parsers share side-effect-free JSON helpers in `src/infrastructure/providers/cli/provider-logs/usage-parse-utils.ts`. The helpers provide strict JSON object/array parsing for JSONL records and balanced object/array extraction for noisy wrapper output, such as Docker bootstrap lines before a Qwen log array or incidental stdout around `opencode export` payloads. Malformed records and wrong-shape payloads are non-fatal: parsers skip the bad record or return `null` for unavailable usage while preserving provider-specific normalization for valid records. Missing usage fields likewise produce `null` usage rather than zeroed reported telemetry, so Code UX does not convert absent provider data into authoritative token counts.

Invocation persistence applies a narrow hygiene sanitizer for one known noisy bootstrap case: lines matching `fatal: your current branch 'code-ux-bootstrap-*' does not have any commits yet` are removed from provider-output message content before chat-facing invocation messages are written. User prompt content bypasses this sanitizer and is stored exactly. Other `fatal:` lines and unrelated stderr/stdout remain unchanged so real failures still surface.

## Chat Thread Usage
Execution invocations are heavily used by the Chat page to track activity.
When chat conversations take place (routed to either connected workers or virtual providers), those discrete operations and interactions generate `execution_invocations` with `type === "chat"`.
This provides a clear audit log of the agent's work and prompt history separate from the user-facing `ConversationThreadRecord` and `ConversationMessageRecord` items.
User-facing chat threads show up with `scope === "project"`, while agent background logs and execution runs appear with `scope === "connection"`.
The dashboard Chat -> Invocations rail renders only `execution_invocations` returned by the server list endpoint or project realtime refreshes. Invocation rows are created by the backend when the routed operation starts or is persisted. Sending a chat message still updates the thread transcript from the returned conversation message immediately, but the invocation rail waits for the persisted backend invocation row instead of inserting a frontend-only optimistic invocation placeholder.

The Chat -> Invocations detail view exposes same-session recovery actions for failed or cancelled planning invocations. **Restart** preserves the original terminal transcript, creates a new invocation row, and resends the full planning prompt while passing the terminal provider row's native session id as `continueSessionId` (Claude Code uses `--resume <nativeSessionId>`). **Continue** uses the same native-session resume path and asks the provider to finish the previous planning attempt, but the continuation prompt also embeds the original planning instructions so a provider fallback to a fresh session still has the full schema, sprint goal, and task-generation context. Docker-backed planning runs use a stable project/sprint snapshot workspace and preserve its paired provider runtime volume while the run is failed, cancelled, or incomplete. Restart and Continue reuse that workspace so provider-local session files remain available; fresh planning invocations in `REMOTE` git mode still refresh `origin` and build a new snapshot from `origin/<branch>`, using the explicit sprint feature branch when present or the effective runtime git default branch otherwise. Successful planning cleans up that workspace and paired runtime volume. The replacement invocation has its own provider usage trail; the terminal row remains immutable evidence of the quota/error/cancellation history. If Claude Code reports "No conversation found" during resume, Code UX retries once with a fresh Claude session and persists that fresh native session id rather than the rejected id.

Running invocations can also be cancelled from the same detail header. Cancellation is available for every running invocation type, not just planning. The dashboard posts to `/api/execution/invocations/:invocationId/cancel`; the server requests any registered active dispatch to stop, finds Docker containers by the existing `code-ux.session-id` label from the linked provider/task runtime, kills those containers, marks the provider usage row `cancelled`, and appends a system cancellation message to the invocation transcript. Provider finalizers check the current invocation state before writing terminal status so a cancelled row is not overwritten by a late provider failure while the process unwinds.

Invocations waiting on provider usage limits expose a **Reset timer** action when they are still active, have `last_retry_after_iso`, and carry `last_error_category = QUOTA_EXHAUSTED` or `RATE_LIMITED`. The dashboard posts to `/api/execution/invocations/:invocationId/reset-usage-limit`; the server clears the retry timestamp and records a transcript audit message. The provider retry loop watches that persisted timestamp while sleeping, so clearing it wakes the active wait and lets the same invocation retry immediately instead of waiting for the original reset time.

## Node Flow Usage

Node-flow execution uses `execution_invocations` as the dashboard-observable audit surface while keeping graph and run details in the node-flow tables.

Runtime behavior:

- `NodeFlowRuntimeService.runFlow` creates one parent invocation with `type = "node_flow"` and links it from `node_flow_runs.execution_invocation_id`.
- The parent invocation starts as `running`, receives a system start message with `flowId` and flow version metadata, and is updated to `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled` when the run finishes.
- Externally observable node types create separate invocation rows with `type = "node_flow_node"` and link them from `node_flow_node_runs.execution_invocation_id`.
- Current externally observable node types are `provider_prompt` and `http_request`. Deterministic nodes such as `input`, `set_fields`, `template`, and `output` only create `node_flow_node_runs` rows.
- Provider prompt nodes pass the existing `node_flow_node` invocation id into `ProviderExecutionService` and disable raw prompt/assistant transcript capture for that node-flow prompt.
- HTTP nodes append a redacted request summary to the node invocation. Secret-shaped query keys are redacted before they are written.

The run tables remain the source for node order, node status, flow input/output, trigger payload, and per-node JSON payloads. Those payloads are masked for secret-shaped keys before persistence and before MCP/dashboard responses.

## Realtime Synchronization

When an invocation or its messages are created/updated, the server emits a project-scoped realtime event.
- \`scheduleProjectExecutionRefresh(projectId, { includeOverview: true })\`: Triggered on major state changes like creation and status updates.
- \`scheduleProjectExecutionRefresh(projectId, { includeOverview: false })\`: Triggered when appending messages to avoid heavy recalculations if only appending content.
- Burst writes are coalesced in \`ExecutionRepository\` per project on the next tick. If any write in the burst requires overview refresh, the coalesced dispatch escalates to \`includeOverview: true\`.

The Live dashboard consumes invocation records through the same project execution snapshot used for runtime events. `getProjectExecutionSnapshot(projectId, { selectedSprintId })` merges three slices into `recentInvocations`: the latest project-wide records, all invocation records for expanded active/paused/queued sprint runs, and all invocation records for the selected sprint. This keeps the Live invocation feed available for stopped or paused sprints even when other sprints have newer activity, while still letting active multi-sprint sessions stream through the existing `project.live.updated` websocket flow. The REST project execution endpoint returns the full bounded feeds, while the realtime `project.execution.updated` channel remains feed-less for payload size. The page-level feed is intentionally summary-level and scoped to the selected sprint when one is selected: status, provider/model/execution mode, task/sprint context, message and prompt/transcript character counts, timing, tokens, and latest error. Task cards filter the same records by task id/task key plus current dispatch and task-run ids to show local invocation activity on the card. Full invocation messages remain loaded on demand from the Chat invocation view.

SQLite startup schema and migrations both maintain scalar indexes for these live snapshot slices: project/sprint/run invocation recency, provider fallback sprint/run recency for legacy rows, active invocation status recency, task dispatch recency, runtime event recency, and attention item status/update ordering. These indexes intentionally avoid prompt, transcript, markdown, JSON, and other large text fields so dashboard polling stays read-efficient without making provider writes heavy.

The Chat invocation pane force-refreshes the selected running transcript whenever the invocation summary changes its `message_count`, `last_message_at`, `updated_at`, or `status` fields. That keeps live reasoning, tool, and assistant updates visible without navigating away and back, while the message equality check also considers content, tool-call payloads, and metadata so in-place transcript edits do not get collapsed into stale cache entries.

Jules-backed task dispatch now creates a running `execution_invocations` row immediately after the task dispatch/task-run rows are created and the Jules provider slot is claimed. The row is linked to the placeholder `provider_invocations` usage record, then re-keyed to the real Jules session id when the API returns. Live and terminal Jules usage syncs reuse that provider-linked execution invocation, rebuild its transcript, and update estimated usage instead of creating a late duplicate. This makes Jules tasks visible in the Live feed and Chat invocation tab as soon as they are dispatched, while still replacing the initial dispatch placeholder message with the authoritative Jules conversation when available.

Older Jules rows may have task/sprint/run metadata only on their linked `provider_invocations` row because the transcript sync created the `execution_invocations` row after dispatch. Invocation read queries therefore project missing sprint, task, dispatch, and task-run scope from the linked provider usage row. Jules live/terminal sync also backfills that scope when it updates an existing row, so legacy records become physically repaired over time.

## Analytics Projection
The `queryProjectInvocations` query powers paginated dashboard analytics, returning matching invocations alongside a computed summary.
Instead of loading all matching invocation rows into memory to compute metrics (which becomes a bottleneck for large projects),
Code UX computes basic summaries, P95 durations, sprint state aggregations, external API metrics, and errors directly through
bounded SQL queries with typed helpers inside `execution-invocations-query-analytics.ts`. This SQL-side projection ensures high
scalability without compromising filter integrity.

## Startup Recovery

CLI-backed provider invocations now persist their workflow execution mode alongside the session id used to launch the worker.

On Code UX restart, runtime recovery reconciles any still-`running` CLI provider invocations before the dashboard rehydrates:
- tracked background CLI sessions recovered from `session-tracking.db` are marked failed because the original owning process exited
- session recovery covers every local CLI provider (`gemini`, `codex`, `claude-code`, `qwen-code`, `opencode`, and `antigravity`) so dashboard session state does not stay `RUNNING` for a provider whose owning process is gone
- Docker-backed invocations are checked against active Docker containers using the `code-ux.session-id` label; if no active container remains, the provider invocation and linked execution invocation are failed and annotated with a recovery message
- stale task-coding execution audit rows also close their linked `session-tracking.db` session when startup recovery reconciles the provider invocation, so the live dashboard does not keep showing a recovered container run as still running

This prevents stale `qa_review` or worker invocations from remaining indefinitely `running` after the underlying container or host process has already exited.

## Relationships

Execution invocations cascade when their parent \`project_id\`, \`sprint_id\`, or \`task_id\` are deleted. They optionally reference \`task_run_id\` or \`dispatch_id\` but function independently to track planning sweeps, conflict resolution, or ad-hoc agent activity.

Node-flow run rows reference execution invocations with `ON DELETE SET NULL`. Deleting an invocation should not delete the node-flow run history, and deleting a node flow cascades its versions, attachments, run rows, and node-run rows through the node-flow table relationships.

Additionally, every execution invocation explicitly links to a `provider_invocations` usage row. The execution transcripts stored in `execution_invocation_messages` serve as the replayable prompt history corresponding to the exact token and time consumption recorded in the usage row, allowing the dashboard Stats page to drill down into the exact sequence that generated specific costs.

`ExecutionRepository` remains the public persistence facade for both sides of this relationship. The table-specific write ownership is split behind that facade: `execution-invocation-writes.ts` owns invocation and transcript mutations, while `provider-invocation-usage-writes.ts` owns provider usage creation, slot-claim creation, provider session association, runtime row association, and usage updates. Both modules preserve the facade's validation behavior, timestamps, returned DTO shapes, and project realtime refresh semantics.

## Provider Slot Waiting Semantics

When a provider's global concurrency limit is reached, ready tasks are deferred rather than blocked with a failure:
1. The task status remains `PENDING` in memory, allowing the task to be rescheduled and retried on subsequent sprint cycles.
2. A `task_run` record is created or updated to have a `state` of `"PENDING"`, and a linked `task_dispatch` is created with a status of `"queued"`.
3. A durable event of type `"provider_concurrency_wait"` is appended to the `task_run_events` table carrying the `provider`, `currentCount`, and `limit` in its payload. This allows the dashboard to display the slot waiting status and show the usage (e.g., `2/2` waiting for slot) without inventing run-failure or code-execution attempts.
4. During concurrent capacity checks, stale provider reconciliation scans (e.g., checking Docker container availability) are throttled and duplicate forced checks coalesce into a single shared scan to avoid excessive external resource calls.
