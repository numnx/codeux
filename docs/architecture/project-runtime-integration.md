# Project Runtime Integration

This page describes the current runtime bridge between the legacy sprint orchestrator and the Sprint OS database model.

## Goal

Project planning is already DB-backed through `projects`, `sprints`, and `tasks`.

This integration extends that model so live execution state is also projected into sqlite for the currently selected project instead of being served only from the process-local `runtimeContext.lastStatus`.

## What Changed

Primary implementation files:
- `src/repositories/project-runtime-repository.ts`
- `src/app/dependency-factory/sprint-factory.ts`
- `src/app/dependency-factory/dashboard-factory.ts`
- `src/app/lifecycle/dashboard-lifecycle-service.ts`
- `src/server/jules-agent-server.ts`

Key behavior:
- orchestrator status updates are now mirrored into sqlite
- selected-project live dashboard data is read back from sqlite
- rerun actions can target DB task ids while still resetting markdown task state by task key
- git/CI tracking now resolves repo path and active branch from the selected project's stored runtime context

## Runtime Source Of Truth

The orchestrator still emits the same `DashboardStatus` payload shape during execution.

That payload is now written into the app database as:
- `app_settings`
  - `runtime_context:<projectId>` stores project-scoped runtime context such as sprint number, repo path, feature branch, report text, instructions, and timestamp
- `task_runs`
  - stores the latest known run/session state per task
- `task_run_events`
  - stores status-sync change events for future timeline and audit views

The dashboard `GET /api/status` endpoint now returns the selected project's runtime projection from sqlite.

## Projection Rules

Project matching:
- `repo_path` is matched against the project's `base_dir` or source reference
- selected project is used as fallback when needed

Sprint matching:
- prefers `sprint_number`
- falls back to `feature_branch`
- falls back to the previously stored runtime context for the same project

Task matching:
- prefers DB task record id when present
- otherwise matches by `task_key`

## Current Boundaries

This is still a bridge layer, not the final runtime architecture.

Current limitations:
- the orchestrator still keeps a process-local `lastStatus` copy for readiness and compatibility
- live activity messages are fetched on demand from provider sessions, not yet persisted into `task_run_events`
- worker MCP assignment and multi-MCP scheduling are not implemented yet
- listen mode now has project-scoped connection/thread/message storage and a pull-based MCP tool loop, but not autonomous server-side dispatch

## Why This Matters

This closes the biggest phase-1 gap:
- v2 project selection now scopes live runtime views
- live dashboard pages no longer depend on one global, unscoped status object
- the app can move toward multi-MCP runtime coordination without replacing the project/sprint/task model again
