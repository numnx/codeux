# Custom Dashboard Foundation

Custom dashboards are a persisted domain model for project-scoped dashboard generation. The foundation stores manifests, generated file bundles, data-source node graphs, validation history, and publication state, and the server-side validation runtime can build and health-check a revision in an isolated Docker session. HTTP routes, MCP tools, and the Preact management workspace are thin layers over the repository and validation-service boundaries.

## Contracts

The shared contracts live in `src/contracts/custom-dashboard-types.ts`.

Primary records:

- `CustomDashboardRecord` stores the mutable project-scoped draft state, status, manifest, generated file bundle, source node graph, styleguide JSON, runtime metadata JSON, credential-ID bindings, an optimistic binding revision, and the active published revision id.
- `CustomDashboardRevisionRecord` stores immutable dashboard bundle snapshots. Manifest, files, source node graph, styleguide data, and credential-ID bindings are copied into each revision so future draft edits or rebindings do not mutate validation or publication history.
- `CustomDashboardValidationSessionRecord` stores validation attempts for a revision, including queued/building/running/passed/failed/cancelled status, validation report JSON, runtime metadata, and timestamps.
- `CustomDashboardManifest` describes the generated dashboard bundle with schema version, title, entry file, file paths, optional data-source graph, bounded credential-slot declarations, and metadata. A slot declares its build/runtime phase, required state, allowed credential kinds, and required capabilities; it never contains secret material.

Dashboard status values are `draft`, `validating`, `validated`, `published`, `rejected`, and `archived`. Validation status values are `queued`, `building`, `running`, `passed`, `failed`, and `cancelled`.

### Feature baseline and bounded addition

Repository history provides the negative baseline for this subsystem: at the pre-feature `dev` commit `716ac2c55`, `CustomDashboardManifest` had no `credentialSlots`, and mutable dashboard and immutable revision records had no `credentialBindings` or binding revision. The implemented change is intentionally limited to bounded manifest declarations, credential-ID bindings in dedicated draft/revision columns, metadata-only compatibility review, optimistic binding mutation, and validation/publication gates. It does not migrate provider secrets and it does not add custom-dashboard secret injection.

Declarations are normalized and bounded for count, slot ID, label, phase (`build` or `runtime`), allowed kinds, and required capabilities. Bindings contain only `slotId` and `credentialId`; generic draft/revision writes cannot set them, and immutable revisions snapshot them. The phase is policy metadata for review and validation, not permission to inject a value into build or runtime artifacts.

## Persistence

SQLite tables are created in both the initial schema and startup migrations:

| Table | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `custom_dashboards` | Current mutable project-scoped draft state, including manifest JSON, file bundle JSON, source node graph JSON, styleguide JSON, runtime metadata JSON, dedicated credential binding JSON, optimistic binding revision, status, and timestamps. |
| `custom_dashboard_revisions` | Immutable revision snapshots with copied manifest, files, source graph, styleguide, runtime metadata, dedicated credential binding JSON, validation status/report, validated timestamp, and revision number. |
| `custom_dashboard_validation_sessions` | Validation history for revisions, including status transitions, report JSON, runtime metadata, and start/finish timestamps. |
| `custom_dashboard_publications` | The active publication pointer for a dashboard. The table is keyed by `dashboard_id`, so each dashboard has at most one active published revision. |

All dashboard JSON payloads are stored as text and hydrated through `CustomDashboardRepository`. Repository methods validate required fields, JSON-safety, project ownership, revision ownership, and publication invariants before writing.

## Repository Boundary

`src/repositories/custom-dashboard-repository.ts` owns persistence. It can:

- list dashboards by project and load a dashboard by id
- create and update draft metadata, manifests, files, source graphs, styleguides, and runtime metadata
- create immutable revisions from the current draft or explicit payloads
- create/update/delete validation sessions and mark a revision validated
- publish only validated revisions
- archive or delete dashboards

Credential IDs mutate only through `updateCredentialBindings`, using compare-and-swap against `credentialBindingRevision`. Generic draft and revision payloads cannot write binding columns. A bound slot must be unbound before its required state, phase, allowed kinds, or required capabilities can change.

Publishing rejects unvalidated, failed, cancelled, or cross-dashboard revisions. Publishing a new validated revision replaces the prior `custom_dashboard_publications` row for the dashboard, preserving the single-active-publication invariant.

## Validation Runtime

`src/services/custom-dashboard-credential-binding-service.ts` owns metadata-only binding orchestration. It loads the project, dashboard or immutable revision, declared slots, secure-backend health, and accessible credential metadata, then delegates every policy decision to `CredentialBroker.assessCompatibility`. Bind/replace/unbind calls use the repository's optimistic mutation and emit correlation-aware audit records containing only project, dashboard, binding revision, slot, credential ID, outcome, and denial reason.

`src/services/custom-dashboard-validation-service.ts` owns server-side validation execution. It consumes the binding service, `CustomDashboardRepository`, `ProjectManagementRepository`, and `SettingsRepository` through the core dependency factory and is exposed to dashboard routes through the dashboard lifecycle dependency object.

Validation flow:

- `startValidation(projectId, dashboardId, revisionId)` first performs a metadata-only revision binding review. A required unbound slot or any missing, revoked, inaccessible, wrong-kind, insufficient-capability, unconfigured, or unavailable-backend binding creates a failed session with slot-specific issues before a workspace or Docker command exists. Optional unbound slots remain valid.
- After that gate passes, validation creates a session, materializes the immutable revision bundle under `.code-ux/runtime/custom-dashboards/<dashboardId>/<revisionId>/workspace`, and writes a generated Vite/Preact harness.
- Validation runtime paths are canonicalized under the selected project before filesystem reads or writes, including bundle materialization, logs, and persisted viewer artifacts.
- The harness injects a read-only Code UX data bridge containing the revision manifest, source node graph, styleguide, runtime metadata, integrations, and declared `external_api` nodes.
- The service runs install/build inside Docker using the resolved `cliWorkflow.containerImage`, then creates and starts a detached serving container on an allocated localhost port.
- A validation session is marked `passed` only after install, build, start, and root URL health checks succeed. Build/start/health failures are recorded as failed validation reports with bounded log excerpts.
- Runtime metadata persists the workspace path, log path, host port, container id/name, image, validation URL path, commands, latest error/log excerpt, and a browser-ready Vite `dist` artifact for passed revisions so the published viewer can render TSX-based drafts without a live validation container.

Validation does not publish or activate dashboards. A successful run only marks the revision validation status as `passed`; publication remains gated by `publishRevision`. REST and MCP publication re-run metadata-only binding review immediately before calling the repository, then require either a revision already marked `passed` with a valid report or an explicit passed validation session for that revision. Failed binding review, queued/running/cancelled validation, missing state, and cross-revision sessions are rejected before the publication pointer changes.

No custom-dashboard service resolves credential plaintext. Build workspaces, generated files and Vite artifacts, Docker arguments/mounts/environment, validation reports/logs, generic REST/MCP records, viewer configuration, iframe `srcdoc`, data-bridge payloads, and `postMessage` traffic receive neither credential values nor binding IDs. Only the dedicated metadata-management response may return binding IDs alongside non-secret credential metadata.

## REST and MCP Surface

Dashboard HTTP routes live in `src/server/custom-dashboard-routes.ts` and are registered with the existing dashboard route groups. They are thin adapters over `CustomDashboardRepository` and `CustomDashboardValidationService`:

- project routes list/create dashboards and expose a data catalog at `/api/projects/:projectId/custom-dashboards/data-catalog`
- dashboard routes get/update/archive a dashboard and create revisions
- validation routes start validation, read status/logs, stop/remove validation sessions, and publish revisions
- validation proxy routes forward same-origin requests to a running validation host port when the session runtime metadata exposes one
- credential-protected project routes list/review slots and optimistically bind, replace, or unbind credential IDs at `/api/projects/:projectId/custom-dashboards/:dashboardId/credential-bindings`

Remote HTTP access to the credential-binding route requires the `credential_admin` role, project access, and enabled remote credential management. The MCP management surface is `manage_custom_dashboards` in `src/mcp/management/custom-dashboard-actions.ts`. In addition to the dashboard lifecycle actions, it supports bounded `list_credential_slots`, `bind_credential`, and `unbind_credential`; binding mutations follow the stateful human-approval fingerprint flow and require the owning project ID.

Project Manager and dashboard chat prompts steer user-created dashboard requests through this management surface. Agents should gather missing purpose, data-source, styleguide, layout, and publication intent details, then create or update drafts and revisions with complete manifests, file bundles, source node graphs, styleguide tokens, runtime metadata, accessibility notes, and validation expectations. Generated bundles are dependency-free Preact/Tailwind-compatible validation-harness code and must not be written directly into `dashboard/src`.

After a revision is created, agents should start validation and wait for a passed validation status before publishing. Failed validation is repaired by creating a new revision from the validation report/logs rather than overriding the active published dashboard.

Validation proxy requests reuse the preview proxy boundary: request bodies are capped at 5 MB, dashboard credentials and hop-by-hop/proxy/control headers are stripped before upstream forwarding, `Origin`/`Referer`/`Sec-Fetch-Site` are normalized to the loopback upstream, and upstream `Set-Cookie`, CSP, CSP report-only, and `X-Frame-Options` response headers are removed before returning to the dashboard origin. Published dashboards have public runtime limits that cap requests and execution.

## Frontend Workspace

The Preact workspace is reachable at `/custom-dashboards` and is lazy-loaded from `dashboard/src/v2/CustomDashboardsPage.tsx`. It is project-scoped through the existing selected-project context and uses typed helpers in `dashboard/src/v2/lib/custom-dashboard-api.ts` for list/get/create/update, revision creation, detached validation sessions, logs, publication, archiving, and data catalog lookup.

The page manages mutable draft text for:

- manifest JSON
- generated file bundle entries and file content
- source node graph JSON
- styleguide JSON
- data catalog source selection

Draft edits remain persisted bundle text sent back through API calls; generated dashboard code is not imported from `dashboard/src` at runtime. Revisions are created as immutable snapshots, then validated through a detached session. The validation panel shows build/start/health stage state, renders refreshed logs, links to the validation proxy preview, and disables publication until the selected revision has a passed validation report or a matching passed validation session. Once a dashboard has an active publication pointer, later validation sessions for draft revisions do not demote the dashboard from `published`, and later validation sessions for the active published revision do not replace its stored validation snapshot.

Published dashboards open through `CustomDashboardViewer`, which resolves the active `publishedRevisionId` from the loaded dashboard detail and renders only when the dashboard status is `published`, the published revision exists, and that revision still has a valid passed validation report. Draft, rejected, archived, unvalidated, and missing-publication states render a local blocked panel with the last validation report and a return-to-editor action rather than executing the bundle.

The viewer uses a sandboxed iframe `srcdoc` document so generated dashboard code never runs inside the main Preact bundle. For validated TSX/Preact revisions, it prefers the persisted Vite `dist` viewer artifact from revision runtime metadata and inlines the artifact's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into the frame document. Older direct HTML or browser-ready JavaScript entry files still render through the previous entry-file path. The frame receives a frozen `codeUxDataBridge` / `CodeUXCustomDashboard` object and can request only declared source nodes by `id` through `postMessage`. Parent and frame handlers verify the expected window source. Generic dashboard/viewer records and frame configuration recursively redact known binding IDs from nested dashboard, revision, source, runtime-metadata, file, validation-report, and viewer-artifact content; only the dedicated metadata-management responses expose IDs. The parent page handles source requests with explicit same-origin API calls for project execution data, project stats, and overview telemetry; integration metadata is limited to non-secret source-node metadata; external API nodes are placeholders and return clear unavailable-source errors.

Navigation is centralized through `dashboard/src/v2/lib/navigation-items.ts`, so both the kinetic dock and sidebar expose the Dashboards destination with stable labels, tour markers, and route prefetching.

## Docker and Logs

Docker argument construction lives in `src/services/custom-dashboard-docker-plan.ts`. Validation containers use the configured CLI workflow image, bind-mount only the generated workspace/runtime home plus an optional setup script, and do not mount provider credential directories. The binding service never calls secret resolution, and credential values and binding IDs are not written to generated files, bridges, validation reports/logs, Docker arguments, iframe configuration, or browser messages. Before bridge configuration is materialized, credential-related properties are removed and known binding IDs are recursively replaced even when they are embedded within larger runtime-metadata or source-node strings.

Logs are captured in the validation runtime directory and combined with bounded `docker logs` output through `getValidationLogs(sessionId, tail)`. `stopValidation` removes the detached container while preserving a passed revision report, and `removeValidation` removes the session row after container cleanup.
