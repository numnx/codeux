## What This Area Is For

Defines the default container environment used by Docker-backed provider CLIs. This page expands the short Settings-page help text into an operator reference for deciding when to change this area, what behavior the controls affect, and what to verify after saving.

Use it when you are configuring a new project, auditing inherited settings, or debugging behavior that changed after a system, project, or sprint override was saved.

## Controls And Runtime Effect

Image, setup script, memory limit, setup image caching, and Playwright browser preinstall shape each worker container.

Managed provider preparation installs registry-resolved CLI versions into isolated Docker volumes. npm lifecycle scripts remain blocked unless a fixed provider catalog entry explicitly requires them: only Claude Code's `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` package and OpenCode's `opencode-ai` package receive that narrow permission. A failed preparation reports the provider package and resolved version, removes the incomplete volume, and remains retryable.

For explicit setup extensions, each Docker runner keeps verified content-addressed setup images hot in process. Warm invocations reuse the verified image without another Docker image inspection or build-context rewrite. If Docker reports that the derived image was removed, Code UX invalidates that readiness entry, rebuilds or resolves the setup image, and retries the launch. Concurrent processes poll setup-image build locks with a short adaptive delay. If restart cleanup removes the lock parent during acquisition, the resolver recreates the parent and retries the same acquisition instead of failing the provider launch. A stale provider-container name is reclaimed before an immediate retry.

Managed workspace and runtime volumes carry the original logical workspace-session label even when their Docker names use a shortened content hash. Startup cleanup compares that durable label with tracked provider sessions and active planning recovery work before removing old volumes; legacy unshortened volume names remain supported as a fallback. This prevents restart cleanup from deleting the preserved snapshot needed by an interrupted provider continuation.

Within one runtime process, independent workspace-manager instances share a runtime-volume readiness and ownership registry. Concurrent preparation and provider launch therefore coalesce volume creation and ownership repair instead of starting duplicate `chown` helpers. Local stress runners wait for terminal owner-scoped workspace cleanup and remove only volumes belonging to their isolated state home before exit, preventing repeated DAG runs from slowing later Docker operations.

| Control Surface | Runtime Effect | Review Before Saving |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Container Image | Defaults to `node:24-trixie-slim`. Managed images are resolved via system, project, or sprint overrides. | Ensure the image contains the toolchain your repository requires. |
| Memory Limit | Defaults to `6144` MB. Caps the maximum memory a provider container can consume. | Overly tight memory limits can fail provider invocations. |
| Setup Image Caching | Defaults to `true`. Warm invocations reuse the verified image without another Docker image inspection or build-context rewrite. | Only disable when explicitly debugging setup script caching issues. |
| Playwright Browser Preinstall | Defaults to `true`. Ensures browsers are available for UI testing. | Disable only if your project does not use Playwright and you want slightly faster cold-starts. |
| Settings card fields | Updates the active Settings scope after you save the page. | Confirm whether you are editing System or Project scope. |
| Inherited values | Values can flow from system defaults into project and sprint behavior. | Check the source badge before assuming a value is project-specific. |
| Related runtime paths | The affected service reads the saved settings during planning, dispatch, dashboard rendering, or maintenance work. | Re-run the affected workflow after changing operational settings. |

## Recommended Configuration

Keep the default image unless your repo needs a custom toolchain; enable Playwright browser preload for browser-heavy QA.

A practical review flow is:

1. Start from the inherited default and change only the fields that solve a concrete operational problem.
2. Save the smallest scope that should own the change. Use System for defaults that every project should inherit, and Project for repository-specific behavior.
3. Reopen the Settings page after saving when the value controls startup behavior, provider routing, preview runtime, or destructive maintenance.

## Risks And Gotchas

Broken setup scripts or overly tight memory limits can fail every provider invocation in the scope.

Before applying changes, check:

- Whether the value affects provider credentials, Docker runtime behavior, Git automation, memory retention, or destructive cleanup.
- Whether a project override is masking the system value you expected to change.
- Whether a running sprint needs to be paused, restarted, or allowed to finish before the new value can be observed.

## Troubleshooting

If the saved setting does not appear to take effect:

- Verify the active Settings scope in the sticky command bar.
- Check for a project or sprint override that takes precedence over the system value.
- Refresh the affected dashboard page if the setting controls a rendered surface.
- Restart the local runtime only when the setting explicitly controls startup, listener, or process-level behavior.
