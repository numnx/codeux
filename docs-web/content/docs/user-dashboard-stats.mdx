# Stats

The **Stats** page (`/stats`) is the analytics surface for the active project. It shows project execution, usage, cost, Git, and invocation telemetry in one workspace with visual-mode navigation, responsive layouts, and light/dark mode support.

The top dashboard header also shows a compact app-wide token-throughput summary alongside running and queued task counts near the runtime controls. It uses a rolling 20-second live activity window, updates once per second, and renders a 20-point stats-card-style sparkline that rises on increases, slopes down on decreases, stabilizes near the 90% band while throughput remains nonzero, and drops to baseline when throughput reaches zero. Use it for a live pulse check; use the Stats page for detailed analysis.

## Time windows

A selector at the top lets you pick the analysis window:

- **Last 1 hour**
- **Last 24 hours**
- **Last 7 days**
- **Last 30 days**
- **All time**
- **Custom range** — pick start and end dates explicitly.

All charts, ledgers, and metrics respect the selected timeframe. Recent windows include the freshest available bucket: **Last 1 hour** includes the current 5-minute bucket, and **Last 24 hours** includes the current partial hour.

## Analysis Modes

Navigation across the top of the workspace controls the primary analysis lens. Stats is organized around model usage, reliability, and composition analysis (as documented in **codeux/internaldocs › V2 project management**). The Usage Chart supports interactive inspection through hover buckets and drag-to-zoom timeframe selection, while the surrounding metric summaries and provider ledger preserve the same information in readable text so the data is usable without relying only on color or pointer interaction.

The six visual modes are:

### Trend
A full-width interactive **Usage Graph** (`UsageChart`) displays usage over time for the series included in the project stats snapshot, such as token totals, active time, cost, telemetry source confidence, and Git activity when those series are present.
- Toggle series in the grouped switch band below the graph or from the graph filter menu. Groups show active/total counts, and each switch shows its color, label, signal type, and current On/Off state.
- **Reset** restores the snapshot defaults. **Enable defaults** turns the default series back on without hiding other series you selected.
- At least one series stays enabled. If you try to turn off the last visible series, the switch remains on and the page explains why.
- Hover, focus, or select a bucket to inspect exact values. Drag-to-zoom changes the visible graph range; it does not change the selected Stats time window. The usage chart is interactive but also exposes an `aria-live` screen-reader summary, an offscreen table of visible buckets, keyboard-focusable bucket regions, and a hidden range input for moving through buckets. It honors reduced-motion preferences for chart animation.
- Hourly views reduce visible axis labels while preserving individual bucket inspection.

### Composition
Visualizes structural breakdowns using interactive donut charts that slice by:
- Token anatomy
- Provider distribution
- Telemetry source mix
Charts feature hover emphasis, center-detail readouts, and are layered above cache efficiency and token-flight timing data, keeping the overall provider picture readable without tab switching.

### Models
Tracks specific model performance, invocation volume, and token throughput for each model used during the active timeframe.

### Providers / Reliability
Focuses on provider usage, telemetry confidence, failure pressure, latency signals, and cost details when the selected snapshot includes those fields.

### Ledgers
Provides tabbed telemetry tables (using `TelemetryLedger` and `GitTelemetry` components) containing raw Task and Sprint data.
- Supports searching and sorting by recency, tokens, time, input/output volume, or name.
- Richer token and time breakdowns compared to standard views.

### System
Exposes administrative invocation telemetry (with expandable `InvocationMessagesPanel` for transcript details):
- Sprint state and invocation-health summaries.
- Classified external API activity.
- Error categories for recorded invocation failures.
- Filtered invocation records with expandable transcript details.

## Cost Metrics and Pricing

Cost data is visualized directly within the Usage Graph and Composition views, fueled by provider configurations.
- You can set `Token pricing` (input / output) on a per-provider-instance basis in **Settings -> Integrations**.
- The Stats page applies these settings retroactively to the raw token telemetry for the selected window.
- **Zero-price / No-pricing behavior:** If a provider has no pricing configured, or if the price is set to `$0.00`, invocations for that provider are tracked and visualized in token counts but will contribute $0.00 to aggregate cost series and cost-focused widgets.

## Underlying telemetry

The page remains live and uses project realtime invalidation channels to stay current during active sprint execution, falling back to background polling when websocket updates aren't available.

It is backed by:
- `GET /api/stats/header-throughput?projectId=...&window=...` — compact app and optional selected-project token throughput read model; the top dashboard header displays the app-wide value.
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/stats?window=...` — aggregated metrics for charts and summaries.
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/execution/invocations` — raw MCP invocation log.
