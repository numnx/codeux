# Telegram Chat Connector

Telegram supports three connection modes. `official_api` connects Code UX directly to Telegram's provider-controlled Bot API. `managed_bridge` and `webhook` retain the existing managed and custom bridge contracts.

## Official Bot API setup

Choose `official_api` and configure:

| Field | Required | Storage | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bot username | No | Setup | Optional identity check, with or without a leading `@` |
| Bot token | Yes | Write-only secret | Authenticates `getMe`, `getWebhookInfo`, and `sendMessage` |
| Webhook secret token | Yes | Write-only secret | Matches Telegram's `secret_token` value for webhook delivery |

Configure the bot's Telegram webhook to the connection's Code UX ingress URL and pass the same webhook secret token as Telegram's `secret_token`. The secret must contain 1-256 characters from `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, and `-`. Webhook configuration remains an explicit operator action: connection verification never calls `setWebhook` or `deleteWebhook`.

Telegram webhook requests are authenticated only by an exact, constant-time comparison of `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token`. Official ingress does not expect Code UX HMAC, signature, nonce, or timestamp headers because Telegram does not send them.

## Inbound updates

The official profile accepts text or caption content from:

- `message`
- `channel_post`
- `edited_message`
- `edited_channel_post`

Duplicate control combines `update_id`, chat ID, and message ID. Telegram identifiers are preserved as decimal strings where Code UX stores external identity, including chat and user identifiers larger than signed 32-bit values. `message_thread_id` is retained for replies into forum topics. Updates whose `from.is_bot` value is true are acknowledged and ignored to prevent reply loops.

Unsupported update kinds or message objects without text/caption content are not converted into Code UX messages.

## Replies and failure handling

Official replies always use Telegram's fixed `api.telegram.org` Bot API origin and `sendMessage`; setup values cannot override that origin. Code UX sends the bound `chat_id`, retained `message_thread_id` when present, and `reply_parameters.message_id` for the source message. Text is bounded to Telegram's 4,096-character `sendMessage` limit without splitting Unicode surrogate pairs.

Code UX validates the Bot API response envelope even when the HTTP response is `200`. A response succeeds only when `ok` is true and the returned message contains `message_id`. Error responses retain the Bot API `error_code` and `description`; a `429` uses `parameters.retry_after` as the exact retry delay.

Timeouts and transport failures after dispatch have an ambiguous delivery outcome, so official mode records them as terminal failures instead of automatically sending a possible duplicate. The bot token is never placed in persisted delivery metadata or log messages, including as part of a Bot API URL.

## Verification and diagnostics

Official verification calls `getMe` to validate the bot token and bot identity, then calls the read-only `getWebhookInfo` method. Diagnostics include the bot identity, whether a webhook is configured, pending update count, allowed updates, connection limits, and the latest webhook delivery error when Telegram supplies one. Verification does not alter the existing webhook. It requires an explicitly configured test bot token; a credential-gated skip is reported as not run, not passed.

## Legacy bridges

- `managed_bridge` keeps optional `workspaceId` and `botUsername` setup with the required `bridgeApiKey` secret.
- `webhook` keeps required `webhookUrl`, optional `botUsername`, required `botToken`, and optional `webhookSecret`. Its endpoint and generic HMAC bridge contract remain unchanged.

Custom outbound endpoints are available only through these explicit legacy modes. They are never considered by `official_api`.
