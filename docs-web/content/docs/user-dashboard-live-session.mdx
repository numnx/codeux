# Live Session

The **Live Session** page (`/live`) is the real-time control room for an active sprint run.

You'll automatically be redirected here when you click **Orchestrate** on a sprint. You can also reach it any time from the dock to view the most recent sprint run for the active project.

Sprint links can open Live directly with `/live?projectId=<projectId>&sprintId=<sprintId>`. Live applies the route project before selecting the route sprint, while later top-nav project or sprint changes replace that route scope atomically. This keeps the selectors and runtime filters aligned without letting an older deep link force the previous project back into view.

## Layout

The page is composed of stacked panels:

1. **Stats header** — High-level metrics: elapsed time, ETA estimate, tasks running, success / failure counts, quota countdown.
2. **Stats deck** — Per-task cards grouped by status. Each card shows:
   - Title, dependency badges, current provider.
   - Live activity preview (the latest line of agent output).
   - Duration and ETA.
   - Optional self-reflection rating badge once a worker has captured one, with the overall 5-star score and a hover/focus details panel for per-section ratings and notes.
   - Buttons to stop, retry, or open the detail panel.
3. **Live Session Runtime Sidebar** — Contains the following collapsible panels:
   - **Invocation feed panel** — A real-time log of individual provider invocations with restart and cancel controls.
   - **Execution timeline** — A horizontal timeline of every event in the run: cycle starts, task transitions, PR opens, merges, attention items.
   - **Git CI status panel** — PR status table for the feature branch: open PRs, CI status, merge conflicts.
   - **Attention ledger** — A dedicated queue for managing human-intervention attention items.
   - **Execution runtime panel** — Core runtime metrics, build statuses, and summary badges.

## Real-time updates

All panels update via the WebSocket connection to `/api/realtime`. Update latency is typically sub-second.

If the WebSocket disconnects (network blip, page sleep), the client automatically reconnects with exponential backoff and replays missed events using the sequence number.

## Self-reflection ratings

Live task cards can show a compact 5-star self-reflection badge when the task snapshot includes `selfReflectionRating`. The badge uses the task's overall rating for the visible score, and hover or keyboard focus opens a viewport-positioned panel with the individual section ratings and any notes the worker recorded. Live tasks without a captured rating do not show a placeholder badge.

## Idle state

If the project has no active sprint run, the page shows the **Idle Runtime State** panel: a friendly explanation that nothing is running, with a link back to the sprint board.

## Attention items

When the engine cannot proceed without input, an attention item is created. It appears as a row in the **Attention ledger** sidebar panel with:

- Category — `merge_conflict`, `ci_failure`, `action_required`, `qa_review_failed`.
- Linked task and PR.
- Recommended action.
- **Claim** button — Mark that you (or a virtual worker) are working on it.
- **Resolve** button — Mark it resolved; the engine will reattempt the cycle.
- **Dismiss** button — Clear the item from the queue when it is no longer relevant.

A virtual worker can claim an attention item too. If you have configured `virtualWorkerProvider` in settings, the engine will offer eligible items to a worker before showing them to you.

When a sprint is selected in the dashboard top bar, the attention ledger follows that selected sprint scope and shows active `open` and `claimed` items for that sprint, including items tied only to one of its sprint runs. With no selected sprint, the ledger keeps the project-wide active queue.

The Overview telemetry panel uses the same selected-project live snapshot for its compact read-only attention queue, so Overview and Live agree on which sprint's blockers are visible.

## Pause / Cancel from the live view

Two large buttons in the page header:

- **Pause** — emits a control message; the watch loop exits cleanly at the next checkpoint.
- **Cancel** — graceful cancellation; live dispatches are signalled to stop.

A **Force cancel** option is hidden behind a confirm dialog.

### Invocation restart/cancel

Individual provider invocations can be managed directly from the **Invocation feed panel** in the sidebar:
- **Cancel** — Stops a running provider invocation.
- **Restart / Continue** — Restarts a failed planning invocation or continues a disconnected session.
- **Reset timer** — Resets the rate-limit timeout for a quota-blocked invocation.

## Finalisation

When all tasks settle, the watch loop runs the *finalisation step*:

- Resolves remaining attention items.
- Optionally runs a QA review pass.
- Checks main-branch merge status.
- Either merges the feature branch into `main` (if `mainBranchAutoMergeMode` allows) or shows you the exact `gh pr merge` / `git merge` command to run.
- Cleans up Docker worktrees from terminal CLI dispatches.
- Triggers memory auto-promotion (short-term → long-term).
- Transitions the sprint to `completed`, `failed`, `paused`, or `cancelled`.

Once finalised, the page presents a one-line summary, a link to the run's stats page, and a **Run again** button.
