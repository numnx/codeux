# Live Session

The **Live Session** page (`/live`) is the real-time control room for an active sprint run.

You'll automatically be redirected here when you click **Orchestrate** on a sprint. You can also reach it any time from the dock to view the most recent sprint run for the active project.

Sprint links can open Live directly with `/live?projectId=<projectId>&sprintId=<sprintId>`. Live consumes a new route project once before selecting the route sprint, while later shared project selection and top-nav scope changes remain authoritative. This keeps selectors and runtime filters aligned without letting an older mounted Live tab repeatedly force its retained deep-link project back into view.

Overlapping selection requests are fenced by request order and project ownership. A late response for the project or sprint you just left cannot switch Live back or place that sprint in the newly selected project's runtime scope.

## Layout

The page is composed of stacked panels:

1. **Stats header** — High-level metrics: elapsed time, ETA estimate, tasks running, success / failure counts, quota countdown.
2. **Stats deck** — Per-task cards grouped by status. Each card shows:
   - Title, dependency badges, current provider.
   - Live activity preview (the latest line of agent output).
   - Duration and ETA.
   - Optional self-reflection rating badge once a worker has captured one, with the overall 5-star score and a hover/focus details panel for per-section ratings and notes.
   - Buttons to stop, retry, or open the detail panel.
3. **Live Session Runtime Sidebar** — Contains the following collapsible panels:
   - **Invocation feed panel** — A real-time log of individual provider invocations with restart and cancel controls.
   - **Execution timeline** — A horizontal timeline of every event in the run: cycle starts, task transitions, PR opens, merges, attention items.
   - **Git CI status panel** — PR status table for the feature branch: open PRs, CI status, merge conflicts.
   - **Attention ledger** — A dedicated queue for managing human-intervention attention items.
   - **Execution runtime panel** — Core runtime metrics, build statuses, and summary badges.

## Real-time updates

All panels update via the WebSocket connection to `/api/realtime`. Update latency is typically sub-second.

If the WebSocket disconnects (network blip, page sleep), the client automatically reconnects with exponential backoff and replays missed events using the sequence number.

## Self-reflection ratings

Live task cards can show a compact 5-star self-reflection badge when the task snapshot includes `selfReflectionRating`. The badge uses the task's overall rating for the visible score, and hover or keyboard focus opens a viewport-positioned panel with the individual section ratings and any notes the worker recorded. Live tasks without a captured rating do not show a placeholder badge.

## Delivery workflow and QA review details

Live task cards use one bright delivery workflow badge in place of the former task lifecycle, QA, and CI badges. The badge remains mounted throughout Coding → Pull request → QA → CI → Merge → Completion. Lifecycle and review state provide the durable base; persisted CI evidence enriches the middle stages when available. Active task-matched human-only intervention changes the trigger to red **Human needed** while retaining the six-stage detail; resolved, worker-owned, system-owned, worker-assigned, and unrelated attention does not.

| Presentation | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Green check, **QA passed** | The QA run completed with a passing verdict. |
| Signal-colored spinner, **QA review running** | A QA provider is actively reviewing the work. Reduced motion replaces the spin and pulse with a static ring and label. |
| Blue pencil, **QA edits** / **QA changes requested** | QA completed successfully and requested changes. This is an actionable review outcome, not a provider failure. |
| Red X, **QA failed** | The QA provider run failed, errored, or was cancelled before returning a usable verdict. It does not mean QA requested code changes. |

Hovering, focusing, or activating the badge opens one viewport-positioned interaction region on a lightly translucent, blurred outer surface. Its opaque Delivery flow card uses six vertically centered circles joined by animated dotted connectors. When review data exists, a floating responsive arrow links it to the opaque QA review card containing the outcome, summary, findings, fix instructions, target task key, reviewer, reviewed time, and generated follow-up tasks. `Escape` restores focus to the exact workflow or QA trigger that opened the region. Reduced motion stops connector and arrow animation without removing state.

Generated follow-up task specifications are collapsed initially, so long prompts do not dominate the review. Each **Follow-up task N** button exposes `aria-expanded` and can be toggled with the keyboard or touch. Expansion reveals the generated title, description, priority, dependency task keys (or **None**), and full Markdown prompt in a bounded scrolling area. The card uses one column on constrained screens, may split summary and findings on wider screens, clamps to the viewport, and scrolls vertically when needed. Reduced motion removes spinner, pulse, rotation, and transition movement without removing labels, borders, focus rings, expanded content, or state semantics.

## Six-stage delivery flow

The workflow badge summarizes the same six stages on Sprints, Tasks, Overview, and Live:

1. **Coding** — waiting, queued, preparing, active, quota/capacity wait, paused, complete, or failed.
2. **Pull request** — waiting for a PR, missing a required PR, creating, or ready.
3. **QA** — pending, reviewing, passed, blue **QA edits**, or provider/runtime failure.
4. **CI** — checks pending, running, passed, or failed.
5. **Merge** — waiting, checking mergeability, ready, merging, merged, not required, conflict, or failed attempt.
6. **Completion** — waiting, complete, failed, or cancelled.

The four first-class workflow states are `pending`, `in_progress`, `successful`, and `failed`. Pending uses a neutral clock, `in_progress` is presented as running with the signal-colored progress treatment, `successful` uses a green check, and `failed` uses a red X. Failed wins over in progress, in progress wins over pending, and pending wins over successful when the overall badge is derived from the three steps.

The red X identifies an actual provider/runtime or workflow failure, or explicit active **Human needed** intervention. A requested-change verdict is blue, not red. A review blocker is not a CI failure: CI remains passed and Merge reads **Waiting for review**. A merge conflict belongs to Merge and remains distinct from **CI failed**.

The badge does not poll per card. Task feature-PR gates are persisted as `ci_gate_status` task-run events, and Live narrows them to the selected sprint and latest dispatch's sprint run before choosing the newest matching event by creation time and event ID. Unresolved CI repair attention is combined while `open` or `claimed`; persisted task merge metadata is durable fallback evidence.

Because the evidence is persisted and rehydrated into the initial Live snapshot, server restarts and browser reconnects reconstruct the same state before realtime updates continue; cards do not need independent recovery timers. A newer recognized settled gate event supersedes an older failed or waiting event for the same task and sprint run, and resolved or dismissed attention no longer forces failure.

## Idle state

If the project has no active sprint run, the page shows the **Idle Runtime State** panel: a friendly explanation that nothing is running, with a link back to the sprint board.

## Attention items

When the engine cannot proceed without input, an attention item is created. It appears as a row in the **Attention ledger** sidebar panel with:

- Category — `merge_conflict`, `ci_failure`, `action_required`, `qa_review_failed`.
- Linked task and PR.
- Recommended action.
- **Claim** button — Mark that you (or a virtual worker) are working on it.
- **Resolve** button — Mark it resolved; the engine will reattempt the cycle.
- **Dismiss** button — Clear the item from the queue when it is no longer relevant.

A virtual worker can claim an attention item too. If you have configured `virtualWorkerProvider` in settings, the engine will offer eligible items to a worker before showing them to you.

When a sprint is selected in the dashboard top bar, the attention ledger follows that selected sprint scope and shows active `open` and `claimed` items for that sprint, including items tied only to one of its sprint runs. With no selected sprint, the ledger keeps the project-wide active queue.

The Overview telemetry panel uses the same selected-project live snapshot for its compact read-only attention queue, so Overview and Live agree on which sprint's blockers are visible.

## Pause / Cancel from the live view

Two large buttons in the page header:

- **Pause** — emits a control message; the watch loop exits cleanly at the next checkpoint.
- **Cancel** — graceful cancellation; live dispatches are signalled to stop.

A **Force cancel** option is hidden behind a confirm dialog.

### Invocation restart/cancel

Individual provider invocations can be managed directly from the **Invocation feed panel** in the sidebar:
- **Cancel** — Stops a running provider invocation.
- **Restart / Continue** — Restarts a failed planning invocation or continues a disconnected session.
- **Reset timer** — Resets the rate-limit timeout for a quota-blocked invocation.

## Finalisation

When all tasks settle, the watch loop runs the *finalisation step*:

- Resolves remaining attention items.
- Optionally runs a QA review pass.
- Checks main-branch merge status.
- Either merges the feature branch into `main` (if `mainBranchAutoMergeMode` allows) or shows you the exact `gh pr merge` / `git merge` command to run.
- Cleans up Docker worktrees from terminal CLI dispatches.
- Triggers memory auto-promotion (short-term → long-term).
- Transitions the sprint to `completed`, `failed`, `paused`, or `cancelled`.

Once finalised, the page presents a one-line summary, a link to the run's stats page, and a **Run again** button.
