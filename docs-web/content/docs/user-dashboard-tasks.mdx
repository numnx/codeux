# Tasks

The **Tasks** page (`/tasks`) is a Kanban-style task board for the active project. It organizes tasks into **Queued**, **In Progress**, and **Completed** lanes, with sprint scope, status, priority, and search controls above the board.

Use it when you want to review planned work, create or edit a task, check dependency blockers, or choose how a specific task should be executed.

## Project and sprint scope

The global project selector in the navbar owns the active project. Changing projects while you are on `/tasks` updates the router to the new project and resets any stale sprint filter that belonged to the previous project, so an older deep-link query cannot switch the selector back.

The sprint selector inside the Tasks page only scopes the board for the current project. Choosing a sprint updates router search state and stores that sprint selection for the active project. Sprint links from the Sprints page use `/tasks?projectId=<projectId>&sprintId=<sprintId>`; the Tasks page switches to the route project first, then stores and loads the route sprint after that project is active. Legacy same-project links such as `/tasks?sprint=<id>` and `/tasks?sprintId=<id>` remain supported.

## Board workflow

The board keeps the current sprint scope and filters visible while you work:

- **Sprint scope** narrows the board to all tasks or one sprint.
- **Status and priority filters** refine the visible cards without losing the current board context.
- **Search** matches task titles and task text.
- **Visible count controls** limit how many cards render in each lane for larger projects.

## Columns

Task cards show the task title, status, priority, dependency state, downstream dependents, executor metadata, recent activity context, optional self-reflection ratings, and available actions. Dragging a card to another lane changes its status when that transition is available.

When a worker reports a task-run self-reflection rating, the shared rating badge appears in the compact card metadata near the task id, status, and priority. It shows the overall `overallRating` as a numeric score with a compact 5-star meter. Hovering the badge, or focusing it with the keyboard, opens a viewport-positioned details panel with each section from `sections`: the section label, matching stars, numeric rating, and any note captured by the worker. Tasks without a captured rating, including older tasks that never produced one, do not render an empty badge slot.

## Create and edit tasks

Use **New Task** or a card's **Edit** action to open the task editor. The editor opens inside the Tasks workspace instead of replacing the board:

- On wide screens, the editor appears as a full-height right-side viewbox beside the board.
- On narrow screens, the editor becomes the primary full-width panel above the board.
- Cancel returns to the board without changing the draft.
- Save keeps the selected sprint scope and active filters in place.

The editor includes:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Title** | Required task name shown on the card. |
| **Description** | Short user-facing summary for scanning the board. |
| **Markdown prompt** | Detailed implementation instructions for the worker. |
| **Status** | Current board state for the task. |
| **Priority** | Planning priority used for board sorting and visual emphasis. |
| **Dependencies** | Other tasks that must be completed first. Dependency choices remain selected even when filtering hides them. |
| **Executor mode** | Task execution preference: automatic, CLI-backed worker, or Jules-backed worker where available. |
| **Worker agent** | Optional task-level worker-agent override. The built-in worker leaves `agentPresetId` empty; choosing a configured agent preset saves that preset id on the task. |

Validation keeps the current draft visible. If a required field is missing, the editor focuses the first invalid field and shows the error inline.

## Dependencies

Dependencies determine whether a task is ready to run. A task with incomplete dependencies remains blocked until those dependencies move to a completed state. Cards show dependency blockers and downstream dependent tasks so you can see both what a task waits on and what it unblocks.

The editor prevents invalid dependency selections such as dependency cycles. When a dependency cannot be selected, the reason is shown in the editor rather than silently hiding the option.

## Task actions

Task cards expose actions for the work that is available in the current state:

- **Edit** opens the full task editor for content, dependencies, executor mode, and worker-agent selection.
- **Rerun** starts a fresh execution attempt for the task when rerun is available.
- **Preview** opens the task's available runtime preview when one exists.
- **Live** opens live task context when runtime details are available.
- **Delete** removes the task after confirmation.

Unavailable actions stay visible with a reason so the board layout remains stable and keyboard users can understand why an action cannot run.

## Status legend

| Lane | States | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Queued** | `pending`, blocked variants | Not ready or not started yet. |
| **In Progress** | `in_progress`, `coding_completed`, `QA_REVIEW_FAILED` | Active work, review, or follow-up is still underway. |
| **Completed** | `completed` | The task is finished. |
