# CI integration

The CI gate is the bridge between Code UX's task graph and your real GitHub-based CI. It decides when each subtask's PR can be merged and how to react when CI is unhappy.

## Source

`src/domain/sprint/ci/feature-pr-gate.ts` (`evaluateCiGate`, ~lines 30–290).

## Gate context

Each invocation receives a `CiGateContext`:

```ts
interface CiGateContext {
  automationLevel: AutomationLevel;
  repoPath: string;
  featureBranch: string;
  defaultBranch: string;
  featureBranchPrefix: string;
  ciIntelligence: CiIntelligenceSettings;
  githubMode: "REMOTE" | "LOCAL";
  gitStatus: GitTrackingStatus | null;
  ciAutofixRetryCounts: Map<string, number>;
  isProviderApiConfigured: () => boolean;
  sendSessionMessage: (sessionId, message) => Promise<void>;
  autoMergeFeaturePr?: (args) => Promise<AutoMergeFeaturePrResult>;
  persistMergedTask: (task) => Promise<void>;
  executionRepository?: ExecutionRepository;
  sprintRunId?: string;
  openCiFixAttentionItems?: (items) => void;
  hasActiveWorkerCiFixAttempt?: (task, prNumber) => boolean;
  evaluateTaskQaGate?: (task) => TaskQaMergeGateStatus;
}
```

## Gate flow

For every subtask in `CODING_COMPLETED`, per cycle:

```
1. Apply pre-gate transitions (evaluatePreCiGateTransition)
   - COMPLETED + unmerged + has merge evidence → CODING_COMPLETED
   - CODING_COMPLETED + settled → COMPLETED

2. If CI disabled or no completed-awaiting-merge tasks → return early.

3. Find matching PR in gitStatus (by worker branch).

4. Branch on PR state:
   ├── Already merged
   │     → status COMPLETED
   │     → is_merged: true
   │     → merge_indicator: MERGED or AUTOMERGE
   │     → persistMergedTask(task)
   │
   ├── No PR found
   │     → status RUNNING (worker hasn't pushed yet)
   │     → merge_indicator: CI
   │
   ├── Merge conflict (DIRTY or rebase failure)
   │     → status CODING_COMPLETED
   │     → merge_indicator: MERGE_CONFLICT
   │     → If resolveMergeConflicts: dispatch merge_conflict worker
   │     → Else: openCiFixAttentionItems
   │
   ├── CI failing
   │     → If waitForProviderCiAutofix and retries < ciAutofixMaxRetries:
   │           dispatch ci_fix worker, increment counter
   │     → Else:
   │           openCiFixAttentionItems
   │
   └── CI green
         → Check comment-resolution gate
         │   (resolveAllCommentsBeforeFeatureMerge → unresolved comments block)
         → Check QA gate (if evaluateTaskQaGate provided)
         │   (returns BLOCKED|PASSED|PENDING)
         → Apply featurePrAutoMergeMode:
             ├── OFF      → no action; merge manually
             ├── CREATE_PR → keep PR open, mark PR_ONLY
             ├── WHEN_GREEN → autoMergeFeaturePr(prNumber)
             └── ALWAYS    → autoMergeFeaturePr(prNumber)
```

## Merge indicators

The `merge_indicator` field on a task documents the latest gate decision:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `CI` | Awaiting worker push or CI run. |
| `AUTOMERGE` | Merged by an auto-merge policy. |
| `MERGED` | Merged manually or via PR_ONLY policy. |
| `MERGE_BLOCKED` | Merge attempt rejected (e.g. failing required check). |
| `MERGE_CONFLICT` | Git conflict on rebase. |
| `PR_ONLY` | PR is open; policy chose not to auto-merge. |
| `QA_PENDING` | QA review pending. |

## GitHub modes

### `REMOTE`

- Uses `gh` CLI / GitHub REST API.
- Reads PR status, CI checks, inline comments.
- Required for `WHEN_GREEN`, `ALWAYS`, comment-resolution gate, QA gate live signals.
- Requires `gh auth status` to succeed (or `GITHUB_TOKEN`).

### `LOCAL`

- Operates only on local Git state.
- PR-related features degrade: no live CI, no auto-merge of remote PRs, no comment gating.
- Useful for offline environments or single-author workflows.

## Auto-merge modes

`featurePrAutoMergeMode` and `mainBranchAutoMergeMode`:

| Mode | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `OFF` | Manual only. Engine surfaces the merge command. |
| `CREATE_PR` | Open the PR and stop. |
| `WHEN_GREEN` | Open + wait for green + comment resolution + QA pass + merge. |
| `ALWAYS` | Merge regardless. *Use carefully.* |

Defaults: both `OFF`. Opt in deliberately.

## CI autofix worker

When `waitForProviderCiAutofix: true` and a PR has failing CI:

1. The guardrail ledger is evaluated for the task, or for a stable sprint-run key during final-merge repair.
2. If an equivalent worker-owned `ci_fix_required` item is already open or claimed, the gate waits without consuming another attempt.
3. Otherwise Code UX opens repair attention and schedules it before ordinary coding dispatches.
4. Task-scoped repairs default to the originating coding task's exact provider session and effective model. Disable **Continue from same session and model as coding task** under Settings → AI Models → CI fix to use the standalone `ci_fix` route instead. Final-merge repairs always use the standalone route because no originating task session exists. The final provider-slot wait is bounded to 30 seconds.
5. The worker receives only the newest branch-matched CI run when that run is failed; a newer successful run suppresses historical failure evidence. Older matching runs are excluded. The selected run includes every failed job and step, exact actionable assertion/error evidence, branch/PR context, and the original task only as reference material. It must produce new patch or unpublished-commit evidence before the attention item can resolve. For each failed job, evidence is selected from the complete log around failed-step names, error markers, expected/received output, stack traces, and source locations instead of runner bootstrap/cleanup noise. The exact `gh run view <run-id> --job <job-id> --log-failed` command remains available as a fallback.
6. Failed, timed-out, crashed, and no-op invocations consume one attempt and are requeued with their last error while budget remains. At the cap, Code UX creates a human handoff with the failed-check context. Task-level planning state stays coding-complete so the original implementation cannot be relaunched as ordinary coding work.

While CI repair owns a task, stale merge-required or merge-conflict attention is closed so the CI repair or its human handoff remains the single authoritative blocker.

GitHub can return superseded check runs for the same head commit. Code UX evaluates only the latest timestamped observation per workflow/check pair. A CI-blocked task remains code-complete through status derivation and is never eligible for ordinary coding redispatch until the blocker is explicitly cleared. CI-repair and coding-budget human handoffs are deduplicated independently by guardrail purpose, and any remaining task guardrail handoff is resolved once the task settles.

Task-level and final-merge repair use the same newest-run-only structured evidence payload. Guardrail handoffs preserve that same run and all of its failed-job details.

Default retry cap: `5`, max `100`; `0` means unlimited.

## Merge-conflict worker

When `resolveMergeConflicts: true` and a PR has a conflict:

1. Dispatch a virtual worker on the `merge_conflict` invocation routing.
2. Pass the conflict file list and the conflict markers.
3. Worker resolves, pushes, and the next cycle re-runs the gate.

If `resolveMergeConflicts: false`, an attention item is opened immediately.

## Comment-resolution gate

`resolveAllCommentsBeforeFeatureMerge` (default `true`) blocks auto-merge until every PR comment with state `OPEN` is resolved. Same for `resolveAllCommentsBeforeMainMerge` on the main-branch step.

The gate inspects comments via `gh api` in REMOTE mode. In LOCAL mode this gate degrades to "no comments visible" and is effectively a no-op.

## QA gate

If a project wires `qa_review` in routing and provides an `evaluateTaskQaGate` implementation:

- Returns `BLOCKED` / `PASSED` / `PENDING`.
- `BLOCKED` → task transitions to `QA_REVIEW_FAILED`, attention item opened.
- `PENDING` → merge held, status remains `CODING_COMPLETED` with `QA_PENDING`.
- `PASSED` → merge proceeds.

## Main-branch merge

The same gate logic runs at sprint finalisation, this time targeting the merge of the feature branch into `defaultBranch`. Settings in play:

- `mainBranchAutoMergeMode`
- `resolveMainMergeConflicts`
- `resolveAllCommentsBeforeMainMerge`

## Live PR monitoring

`enableLivePrMonitoring: true` (default) makes the watch loop poll PR status every cycle even when no immediate action is needed, so the dashboard's Git CI status panel stays current.

## Telemetry

Per gate evaluation, the engine records:

- Decision made (advance / block / merge).
- PR number, CI status snapshot.
- Reason (e.g. `MERGE_CONFLICT`, `WAITING_FOR_CI`, `AUTOMERGED`).

Visible via `/api/projects/:id/execution/invocations?type=ci_gate` and the live timeline.
