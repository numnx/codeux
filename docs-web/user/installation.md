# Installation

Code UX runs entirely on your machine. You can install it as a **desktop app** or build it from
**source** — both ship the same runtime, dashboard, and MCP server. You can
install and start Code UX with **no configuration**; providers are set up later from the dashboard.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Needed for | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Node.js 22+** | Source installs | Not required for the desktop app, which bundles its own runtime. |
| **Docker** | Containerized (default) execution and preview containers | Recommended. Without it, run providers in host mode. |
| **Git ≥ 2.30** | All project work | Code UX manages branches, worktrees, and merges. |
| **An agent provider** | Dispatching work | At least one of Jules, Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Qwen Code, OpenCode, or Antigravity. See [Providers and models](./providers-and-models.md). |
| **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** | Remote merge protocol *(optional)* | Used when GitHub operations run in remote mode. |

## Onboarding dependency installers

First-run readiness checks report Docker CLI, Docker daemon, and Git CLI status. The backend also
probes installer prerequisites before advertising safe Docker/Git setup options: supported Linux
package managers plus `systemctl`, Homebrew on macOS, and winget on Windows. These options are
structured metadata only until an installer action is invoked, and installer execution is limited
to hardcoded command and argument arrays with bounded output capture. Onboarding invokes installation through
`POST /api/onboarding/dependencies/install` only after sending the selected `mode` with
`confirmInstall: true`; unsupported modes and unconfirmed requests are rejected.

| Platform | Recommended mode | Automated behavior | Manual or degraded behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **macOS** | `docker-desktop-git` | Uses Homebrew to install Docker Desktop and Git when Homebrew is available. | `docker-engine-git` is degraded because standalone Docker Engine requires a Linux VM; use Docker Desktop unless you manage that VM yourself. |
| **Windows** | `docker-desktop-git` | Uses winget exact package installs for Docker Desktop and Git, including package/source agreement flags. | `docker-engine-git` is degraded because Docker Engine is not installed directly on Windows desktops; use Docker Desktop or WSL guidance instead. |
| **Linux** | `docker-engine-git` | Uses `apt`, `dnf`, `yum`, `zypper`, or `pacman` to install Docker Engine packages and Git, then attempts to start Docker with `systemctl` when available. | Linux Docker Desktop artifacts are distro-specific, so `docker-desktop-git` automates Git when possible and points to Docker's official Desktop download guidance. |

Linux privilege handling is noninteractive. Root runs package commands directly; non-root runs use
`sudo -n`. If passwordless sudo is unavailable, Code UX returns the display commands and privilege
guidance instead of prompting for a password.

In onboarding, missing Docker/Git checks show an explicit **Auto Install dependencies** action when
the recommended installer is available. Clicking it sends the recommended confirmed installer mode and
lets Code UX run the detected OS package manager for Docker and Git. The same step also keeps advanced
**Docker Desktop + Git** and **Docker Engine + Git** choices visible with platform availability,
degraded/manual-download guidance, privilege notes, live progress, command summaries, retry, recheck,
and manual Docker/Git links for fallback.

Installer attempts do not mark onboarding complete. After any completed installer response, including
permission-limited or manual-download outcomes, onboarding shows the structured result and rechecks
readiness so Docker CLI, Docker daemon, and Git status refresh. You may still need to refresh your
terminal PATH, start Docker Desktop or the Docker Engine daemon, add your user to the Docker group, or
rerun from an elevated shell. Permission failures are shown as guidance with bounded command summaries
and short command messages, not as raw full command output.

## Option 1 — Desktop app (recommended)

Download the latest installer for your platform from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/codeux-ai/codeux/releases/latest):

| Platform | Artifact |
| --- | --- |
| **Windows** | `Code-UX-<version>-win-x64.exe` |
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon) | `Code-UX-<version>-mac-arm64.dmg` (or `.zip`) |
| **Linux** | `Code-UX-<version>-linux-x86_64.AppImage`, `…-linux-amd64.deb`, or `…-linux-x64.tar.gz` |

> On Windows, SmartScreen may warn that the publisher is unrecognized because the build is not yet
> code-signed. Choose **More info → Run anyway**. Only do this for builds downloaded from the official
> releases page.

The desktop app launches the runtime and opens the dashboard automatically. When a newer desktop
release is available, the title bar shows an **Update available** download notice. Activating it
opens the official GitHub release download page in your default browser; the app does not navigate
away from the dashboard.

## Option 2 — From source

Use a source build to develop Code UX itself or inspect the runtime. Requires Node.js 22+ and
pnpm 10.33+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codeux-ai/codeux.git
cd codeux
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm start
```

See [Building from source](../developer/building-from-source.md) for the full developer workflow.

## First run

When Code UX starts it:

1. Serves the dashboard at `http://localhost:4444`.
2. Exposes an **MCP server** (over stdio, plus an authenticated Streamable HTTP gateway).
3. Probes system readiness via `GET /api/onboarding/readiness` to check for Docker and Git, then presents a guided onboarding flow.
4. Loads any settings it finds, then waits for you to add a project and configure providers.

Nothing is required to reach this point — no API keys, no environment variables. Configure providers
when you are ready to dispatch work (see [Configuring providers](#configuring-providers)).

For headless server deployments, use `--server-mode` with an explicit MCP HTTP bearer token. Server mode does not bind dashboard routes or websockets; operators connect through authenticated MCP HTTP and probe `/health` and `/ready` on the MCP listener.

## CLI flags

Run `codeux --help` for the authoritative list. The current flags are:

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--api-key VALUE` | Set the Jules API key (overrides env and settings). |
| `--runtime-role VALUE` | Runtime role: `project_manager` (default) or `worker-host`. |
| `--headless` (alias `--no-dashboard`) | Start MCP-only without binding the dashboard. |
| `--server-mode` | Start authenticated MCP HTTP server mode without binding dashboard routes or websockets. Requires an explicit bearer token with at least 32 bearer-safe characters. |
| `--no-mcp-http` | Preferred alias for disabling the MCP Streamable HTTP gateway outside server mode. |
| `--mcp-https` / `--no-mcp-https` | Enable/disable the MCP Streamable HTTP gateway (**enabled by default**; legacy flag name). |
| `--mcp-http-port N` | Preferred alias for the MCP HTTP gateway port. |
| `--mcp-https-port N` | Port for the MCP HTTP gateway. |
| `--mcp-http-host H` | Preferred alias for the MCP HTTP gateway host/interface. |
| `--mcp-https-host H` | Host/interface for the MCP HTTP gateway. |
| `--mcp-http-path P` | Preferred alias for the MCP HTTP gateway path. |
| `--mcp-https-path P` | Path for the MCP HTTP gateway (default `/mcp`). |
| `--mcp-http-auth-token VALUE` | Preferred alias for the MCP HTTP bearer token. |
| `--mcp-https-auth-token VALUE` | Bearer token for MCP HTTP requests; overrides the generated user token. |
| `--mcp-http-max-sessions N` | Preferred alias for the active Streamable HTTP session cap. |
| `--mcp-http-session-timeout-ms N` | Preferred alias for the idle Streamable HTTP session timeout. |
| `--help`, `-h` | Show help. |

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `JULES_API_KEY` | Jules API key (also accepted as `JULES_KEY`). |
| `DASHBOARD_PORT` | Dashboard port (default `4444`). |
| `CODE_UX_SERVER_MODE` | Set to `true` for authenticated MCP HTTP server mode without dashboard binding. Requires an explicit bearer token with at least 32 bearer-safe characters. |
| `MCP_HTTP_ENABLED` | Preferred alias to enable the MCP HTTP gateway. |
| `MCP_HTTPS_ENABLED` | Enable the MCP HTTP gateway (default `true`). |
| `MCP_HTTP_PORT` | Preferred alias for the MCP HTTP gateway port. |
| `MCP_HTTPS_PORT` | Port for the MCP HTTP gateway. |
| `MCP_HTTP_HOST` | Preferred alias for the MCP HTTP gateway host/interface. |
| `MCP_HTTPS_HOST` | Host/interface for the MCP HTTP gateway. |
| `MCP_HTTP_PATH` | Preferred alias for the MCP HTTP gateway path. |
| `MCP_HTTPS_PATH` | Path for the MCP HTTP gateway. |
| `MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN` | Preferred alias for the MCP HTTP bearer token. |
| `MCP_HTTPS_AUTH_TOKEN` | Bearer token for MCP HTTP requests; if unset, Code UX creates `~/.code-ux/security.json`. |
| `MCP_HTTP_MAX_SESSIONS` | Preferred alias for the active Streamable HTTP session cap. |
| `MCP_HTTP_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS` | Preferred alias for the idle Streamable HTTP session timeout. |

In server mode, `MCP_HTTPS_AUTH_TOKEN`, `MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN`, `--mcp-https-auth-token`, or `--mcp-http-auth-token` must provide an explicit token with at least 32 bearer-safe characters. Server mode does not fall back to the generated user token.

For server-mode startup commands, token handling, worker enrollment, settings synchronization, and troubleshooting, see [Connecting MCP clients](./mcp-clients.md#secure-headless-server-mode).

A project-local `.env` file is read on startup, so you can keep settings per repository:

```bash
# .env
DASHBOARD_PORT=4444
JULES_API_KEY=...        # only if you use the hosted Jules provider
```

## Configuring providers

Code UX needs at least one provider to dispatch work. Configure them from **Settings → Providers** in
the dashboard:

- **Jules** (hosted) uses an API key. Set it in the dashboard, via `--api-key`, or via
  `JULES_API_KEY`.
- **Local CLI providers** (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Qwen Code, OpenCode, Antigravity) use their own
  CLI login. Install and authenticate the provider's CLI, and Code UX detects local auth at:

| Provider | Detected at |
| --- | --- |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/` |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/` |
| Claude Code CLI | `~/.claude/` |
| Qwen Code CLI | `~/.qwen/` |
| OpenCode CLI | `~/.local/share/opencode/` or `~/.config/opencode/` |

When running providers in Docker, enable auth mounting per provider so the worker container can use
your local credentials. See [Providers and models](./providers-and-models.md) for routing and model
configuration.

## Settings files

Beyond the dashboard, Code UX reads JSON settings from a `.code-ux/` directory in the config search
path (project and home directory). For example:

```jsonc
// ~/.code-ux/settings.json
{
  "julesApiKey": "..."
}
```

See [Configuration](../developer/configuration.md) for the full search path and precedence rules.

## Updating

```bash
# source
git pull
pnpm install
pnpm run build

# desktop app
# use the title-bar Update available notice, or download and run the latest installer from GitHub Releases
```

## Uninstall

```bash
# source
rm -rf ~/.code-ux
```

This removes the home-directory settings. Project-local `.code-ux/` directories are
left in place — remove them per project if you no longer need them.
