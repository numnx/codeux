# User Guide

Welcome to Code UX. This section is written for users running sprints — through the dashboard, through an MCP client like Gemini CLI or Claude Desktop, or both.

If you have not installed Code UX yet, start with [Installation](./installation.md) and then [Quickstart](./quickstart.md). Everything else is reference material you can read on demand.

## Glossary (quick reference)

- **Project** — A repository under management. Has its own settings, sprints, agents, memory, and MCP connections.
- **Sprint** — A bounded unit of work containing one or more subtasks. Owns a feature branch; merges to `main` on completion.
- **Subtask** — A single delegated unit of coding work. Stored as a markdown file with YAML frontmatter (status, dependencies, prompt).
- **Agent preset** — A reusable persona (system instructions, avatar, memory template) that a worker can adopt.
- **Worker** — A runtime that executes a task. Either the **Jules** hosted API or a **virtual worker** running a CLI provider (Gemini, Codex, Claude Code, Qwen Code, OpenCode) on the host or in Docker.
- **Sprint run** — A single execution attempt of a sprint. A sprint can be run, paused, cancelled, and re-run repeatedly.
- **Attention item** — Anything that needs human or worker attention: a merge conflict, a CI failure, an awaiting plan approval, a clarification request.
- **Watch loop** — The continuous monitoring loop that polls task state, advances dependencies, and emits checkpoint reports.
