# Node Flows

The **Nodes** page (`/nodes`) is where dashboard users create and operate saved node-flow workflows for the active project. A node flow is a repeatable graph that can be validated, run manually, scheduled, inspected through persisted runs, and attached to project agents as a reusable skill.

## Flow Library And Canvas

The flow library lists project-owned flows. Selecting one opens an editable graph canvas with nodes, directed edges, positions, and node JSON data. The canvas is built into Code UX and is not a generic n8n importer; runtime execution supports Code UX node types rather than arbitrary external workflow nodes.

New editable canvas surfaces use a pure dashboard state module for typed nodes, ports, edges, config fields, selection, deterministic layout, validation issues, JSON serialization, and malformed-draft recovery. Its starter graph lays out trigger, agent, task, condition, and output nodes so workflows begin from a useful Code UX shape.

Agent-driven graph edits use a separate UI-free helper that accepts structured JSON commands for adding nodes, patching node fields, connecting ports, deleting graph entities, selecting entities, and replacing a graph from serialized JSON. The helper applies commands through the canvas reducer and returns deterministic summaries, diffs, and validation blockers.

Side panels stay controlled by the page shell: the palette emits typed create-node actions, the inspector
emits field/config/metadata changes for the selected node, edge details are read-only, and validation
issues expose select/focus callbacks for the affected node or edge.

## Dynamic Widgets

The inspector renders widget schemas attached to the selected node. Supported field types are text, textarea, number, boolean, select, JSON, secret reference, and key-value entries. Graph-level input widgets describe manual or scheduled run input.

Use secret reference fields for credentials. Do not paste raw tokens, API keys, cookies, passwords, or private headers into widget defaults, node data, metadata, or run input.

## Validation

Validation checks graph shape before saving: unique node ids, valid edge endpoints, acyclic edges, JSON-safe data, and valid widget field definitions. Validation issues are shown as field-level messages so you can repair the draft before saving.

A graph can be structurally valid even when it contains a future node type that the runtime cannot execute yet. Current executable node types are `input`, `set_fields`, `template`, `provider_prompt`, `http_request`, and `output`.

## Running And Inspection

The manual run panel accepts JSON object input and starts a node-flow run. Runs persist both the parent flow result and per-node rows, including status, error messages, redacted input/output, and linked execution invocation ids when a provider or HTTP node is externally observable.

Rendered run payloads redact secret-shaped keys such as `apiKey`, `authorization`, `cookie`, `password`, `secret`, and `token`.

## Agent Attachment

A flow can be attached to a project agent preset as a repeatable skill with a name and description. Detaching removes only that binding; the flow, its graph, schedules, and run history remain in the project.

## Scheduling

Use the [Scheduler](./scheduler.md) page to run a saved node flow once or on a recurrence. Scheduled node-flow entries select a project-owned flow and may include optional JSON object input. Pause, resume, failure handling, and due-run behavior match the normal scheduler model.
