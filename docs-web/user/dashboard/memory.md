# Memory

The **Memory** page (`/memory`) manages Code UX's two-tier semantic memory system and the embedding models that power it.

## The two tiers

| Tier | Scope | Lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Short-term** | One sprint | Created during a sprint run. Promoted to long-term on completion (if eligible) or pruned. |
| **Long-term** | One project | Stable knowledge — architectural decisions, codebase landmarks, recurring constraints. |

Both tiers are vector-indexed using a locally-running embedding model (ONNX Runtime). No memory ever leaves your machine.

## Categories

Each memory has a **category**:

- `context` — generic context (default).
- `architecture` — design decisions, architectural rules.
- `codebase` — file/symbol landmarks.
- `preferences` — formatting, naming, and style preferences.
- `patterns` — recurring implementation patterns.
- `decision` — explicit technical decisions made.
- `error` — known errors or workarounds.
- `learning` — task learnings.

Categories drive default rendering and can be used as filters in search.

## Header summary, filters, and actions

The Memory header is the main place to choose what the graph, sidebar, and inspector are showing. It is grouped into separate rows so the current state stays readable on desktop and wraps cleanly on narrow screens:

- **Tier summary tabs** — **Short Term** and **Long Term** show their memory counts directly in the tab cards.
- **Current scope line** — shows copy such as `Short Term: showing 7 memories of 17 memories · Sprint 2 · All Agents` or `Long Term: showing 1 memory of 1 memory · Project-wide · All Agents`.
- **Scope filters** — Short-term memory shows the sprint selector and both tiers show the agent preset selector. Disabled selectors remain visible with reason copy when there are no matching sprints or agent presets.
- **Actions** — **Add Memory**, **Model Catalog**, and **Danger Delete** are separated from the selectors. Model Catalog shows whether it is shown or hidden plus active-model status. Danger Delete always shows Off/Armed state plus persistent explanatory copy.

The sidebar search field filters the current visible tier, sprint, and agent slice by memory text/category. Programmatic semantic search still uses vector similarity across requested scopes (cosine similarity, configurable `minSimilarity`).

Danger Delete semantics are unchanged: graph and inspector single-memory deletes are immediate only while Danger Delete is armed, while sidebar card deletion uses its separate arm/cancel guard.

## Creating a memory

Click **Add Memory**. Provide:

- **Content** — the memory body (markdown supported).
- **Category** (default `context`).
- **Scope** — `project`, `sprint`, or `agent`.
- **Strength** — initial weighting; defaults to `1.0`.
- **Sprint / agent** — required if scope is `sprint` or `agent`.

The memory is embedded immediately using the active embedding model.

## Editing & deleting

Sidebar memory cards use their own guarded delete flow. Graph and inspector single-memory deletion is immediate only while Danger Delete is armed.

The sidebar list supports **batch deletion**: select multiple memories and use the batch action bar to clear or delete the selection.

## Promotion (short-term → long-term)

The dashboard exposes a **Promote** flow:

1. **Analyse** — Code UX scores each short-term memory by recency, recurrence, and embedding centrality.
2. **Review** — A modal presents a ranked list with an explanation per item.
3. **Execute** — Approved items are copied to the long-term scope (originals remain available until pruned).

Auto-promotion also runs as the final step of a sprint when the sprint settles successfully.

## The graph view

Open a memory and click **Inspect** to see its **embedding map**: a 2D projection of nearby memories with edges to top-K neighbours. Useful for spotting clusters and duplicates.

You can rebuild the map after re-embedding or after promotion.

## Embedding models

The right sidebar lists available embedding models. Each card shows:

- Model ID and provenance (e.g. `bge-small-en-v1.5`).
- Download status (not downloaded / downloading / ready).
- Vector dimensionality.
- Whether it is currently active.

The local embedding runtime supports both BGE-style WordPiece tokenizers and XLM-R/SentencePiece Unigram tokenizers such as `multilingual-e5-large`.

Actions per model:

- **Download** — Pulls model weights to local cache.
- **Cancel download** — Aborts an in-flight download.
- **Select** — Activates the model. Subsequent embed operations use it.
- **Delete** — Removes the local cache.

### Re-embedding

Switching the active model leaves existing memories embedded with the previous model — search results across mixed dimensions are nonsensical. Click **Re-embed all** to re-vectorize the project's memories with the new model. Progress is shown live; you can leave the page and check back.

## Persistent skills

Persistent skills are reusable agent instructions, not sprint learnings. They are stored in project-owned skill storages, attached to agent presets, and kept out of the project workspace and `.code-ux/` sprint files.

Skill markdown has frontmatter for `title`, `description`, `tags`, `appliesTo`, and `version`; the markdown body is the stored instruction content. When embeddings are available, skills are vectorized into `skill_embeddings` with model and dimension metadata. Search only compares vectors from the requested project/storage or agent-attached storages, skips dimension mismatches, caps candidate loading, ranks by cosine similarity, and uses skill id as a deterministic tie-breaker.

## Stats

The footer shows aggregate memory statistics: total counts per scope/category, average strength, and the active model.

## Programmatic access

The Memory MCP tool (`manage_memory`) includes raw memory actions (`search`, `list`, `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `promote`), re-embed/model/map/count actions (`start_reembed`, `model_status`, `get_map`, `count`), and durable claim actions (`create_claim`, `list_claims`, `get_claim`, `update_claim`, `add_claim_evidence`, `deprecate_claim`). Destructive lifecycle actions (`delete`, `deprecate_claim`) require approval confirmation. See [Management actions → memory](../../developer/management-actions.md#memory).
