# The Dashboard

The Code UX dashboard is a real-time Preact application served at `http://localhost:4444` (configurable with `DASHBOARD_PORT`). It is the primary interface for humans operating Code UX.

This page mirrors the canonical dashboard guide and the active v2 page files, where v2 is the active UI backed directly by `dashboard/src/v2/*Page.tsx`. Each subsection links to a dedicated page.

## Layout
Project and sprint selection are global header concerns. Navigating to `/live` or `/tasks` with `projectId` and `sprintId` sets the active project once, but subsequent selector changes remain authoritative. Easy, Standard, and Expert modes filter active navigation. In Live views, hidden lower details disable their Git-status data channel and skip Expert-only task-card projections instead of computing unseen operational data. The dashboard is a view-only layer presenting SQLite-persisted backend state and does not reconcile competing states.


The dashboard uses a **dock-based navigation** by default:

- **Dock** *(desktop)* — A floating dock at the screen edge with one icon per page plus a settings button.
- **Sidebar** *(mobile or user preference)* — A collapsible left sidebar.
- **Top bar** — Project selector, global search, tech-stack guidance selector, styleguide selector, sprint selector, theme toggle, mobile menu.

A choice of theme (Light / Dark / System) is in the top bar; navigation mode override is in **Settings → Appearance**. During onboarding, Appearance choices preview immediately and the setup shell follows the selected Light, Dark, or System theme instead of forcing dark mode. Background Mode, Static Color, and supported Zoom Level also preview before save, while advanced background controls such as Animation Style, Pattern Overlay, and custom background image remain in **Settings → Appearance**.

Primary navigation also follows the persisted experience mode in **Settings → General**:

- **Easy** — Chat, Sprints, Browser Preview, Stats, Live, Settings/Config, and the internal Docs page.
- **Standard** — Chat, Overview, Sprints, Tasks, Agents, Nodes, Stats, Scheduler, Browser Preview, Live, Docs, and Settings/Config.
- **Expert** — the full navigation, and the default for new or legacy settings.

Hidden pages remain registered routes, Docs opens the external project docs, and Browser Preview still follows the project sprint-preview visibility settings.

When a project is active, the top bar shows tech-stack guidance and styleguide selectors beside global search. Imported and existing projects can remain at **None** until guidance is explicitly selected. Choosing an entry saves the project guidance override immediately; use [Styleguides and Tech Stacks](./styleguides-and-tech-stacks.md) for the full workflow.

The background is an animated Three.js scene ("Deep Ocean") that lazy-loads after the main UI is interactive, so it never blocks first paint. Onboarding can preview Theme, Navigation Mode, Reduced Motion, Background Mode, Static Color, and supported Zoom Level; advanced background controls such as Animation Style, Pattern Overlay, and custom background image remain in **Settings → Appearance**.

## Language

Open **Settings → Appearance → Display Settings → Language** to switch dashboard-owned interface copy between English and Deutsch. English is the default. The change applies immediately, persists only in the current browser profile, follows other open tabs in that profile, and updates the page's HTML `lang` value. It does not modify backend settings, provider/runtime content, or user-authored data. See [Dashboard Language and Internationalization](./internationalization.md) for the full workflow and content boundaries.

## Notifications and human intervention
Read and dismissed state is stored in the browser for that notification version, and becomes actionable again if the source is updated later.


The top-nav notification center projects the newest 20 records from `GET /api/notifications?limit=20` to show issues across projects. It also includes global startup readiness and active scheduler notices for the selected project. Startup notices identify missing required dependencies and provider misconfiguration; when no usable provider authentication is detected, **Open onboarding** remains available.

Execution notifications include the project, sprint, and task when those levels exist. Select **Details** to review:

- Project, and optional Sprint and Task context.
- What went wrong and why it needs attention.
- Recommended next steps.
- Timestamp and source context.

Sprint-level records omit Task rather than showing placeholder task data. Opening Details or following the notification action marks the item read. Read and dismissed state is stored in the browser for that notification version; if the same source is updated later, the new version becomes actionable again.

Notification actions use project-aware destinations supplied by the server. A task notification opens its scoped Tasks route, a sprint-run notification can open Live, and sprint or project routes are used as fallbacks. The links keep their real destination and query parameters for browser and assistive-technology behavior while normal dashboard navigation stays in-app. Before navigation, the Details modal and notification panel close so navbar overlays cannot cover the destination; focus returns to the notification trigger without reopening the panel. When the notification belongs to another project, its destination applies that project selection; sprint fallbacks also select the supplied sprint before showing the sprint workspace.

After the first execution-feed snapshot loads, each genuinely new or updated intervention, failure, automatic stop, or system error produces one contextual toast. Existing records do not all toast at startup, and unchanged refreshes or reconnects do not repeat them. Warning notifications use the standard bottom-right toast stack. System errors use a persistent assertive error toast and remain until dismissed or opened. Startup and scheduler notices stay in the notification center rather than creating execution toasts.

Notification panel and toast transitions honor reduced motion: reveal and reordering happen immediately, while severity, read/unread state, cross-project context, action labels, keyboard focus behavior, and screen-reader announcements remain available. The Details modal traps focus, supports Escape, and returns focus to its trigger when closed.

## Overview telemetry

The Overview telemetry rail combines cross-project runtime health with selected-project detail. The read-only `GET /api/notifications?limit=20` feed refreshes with the existing `overview.telemetry.updated` realtime event without repeating startup readiness checks.

- Cross-project intervention cards still show active projects that need human attention.
- Active sprint cards and the runtime timeline continue to summarize work across active projects.
- When the top bar has a project selected and that project's live snapshot contains active attention items, Overview shows a compact **Selected Sprint Attention Queue** inside the telemetry panel.

The Overview queue follows the same selected sprint scope as the Live page. If a sprint is selected in the top navigation, the queue shows only the active attention items returned by the selected-sprint live snapshot; unrelated sprint blockers are not reconstructed in the browser. Overview renders the queue read-only, so claim, resolve, and dismiss actions remain on the Live page.

Overview active-stream task rows use the shared bright delivery workflow badge instead of a standalone QA badge. The badge combines each task's persisted lifecycle, review, and merge state with task-scoped realtime CI events and attention, matching the projection used on Tasks and Live. Open it to inspect the current Coding → Pull request → QA → CI → Merge → Completion stage. Active task-matched human-only attention appears as red **Human needed**; resolved, machine-owned, worker-assigned, and unrelated items do not override the stage. When a review exists, the responsive arrow floats between the independent workflow and QA cards; requested edits stay blue, and reduced motion keeps every state visible while stopping connector and arrow animation.

## Loading behavior

Overview requests a compact active-sprint task feed instead of downloading historical task prompts, reviews, and ratings. The top-bar counters share that request, while Active Streams and the telemetry rail reuse the page's realtime execution snapshot for current task-scoped CI/merge evidence instead of issuing a duplicate Live request. Full task details still load when a workflow needs them, including the Tasks page and an opened global search.

The wide seven-day analytics snapshot refreshes every 30 seconds on Overview rather than on each execution heartbeat. The dedicated Stats page remains realtime for operators actively inspecting telemetry.

Creation dialogs, onboarding, the guided tour, and animated backgrounds load outside the first-content path. This keeps the shell interactive while those optional experiences prepare in the background.

## Real-time data
The transport detects sequence gaps via `lastSequence`, uses ready/heartbeat events, and applies reconnect backoff. The UI displays stale status banners and falls back to background polling (e.g., 30s for the live snapshot and 10s for Git status) when disconnected. WebSocket event delivery is not durable beyond the server's in-memory replay storage buffer.


The dashboard maintains a live connection to the server using a custom WebSocket protocol via `GET /api/realtime` (e.g., `ws://localhost:4444/api/realtime` for local HTTP dashboards, and `wss://<host>/api/realtime` for HTTPS deployments). On the server side, `DashboardRealtimeService` in `src/services/dashboard-realtime-service.ts` coordinates events, and the websocket upgrade/transport is handled in `src/server/dashboard-realtime-websocket-server.ts`. The connection:

- Subscribes to *scopes* (e.g. `project:<id>`, `execution`, `git-status`).
- Receives push events for sprint/task transitions, attention items, memory updates, Git status changes.
- Tracks a `lastSequence` for resumable reconnection.
- Falls back to resource-specific REST snapshots if the WebSocket cannot be established or drops events.

REST resource snapshot caching and cadence:

| Resource | Cadence |
| --- | --- |
| `/api/git-status` | 10 s cache TTL |
| `/api/live` snapshot | heavy payload bypassing live updates unless forced by `snapshot_required` |

## Accessibility

The dashboard targets WCAG 2.1 AA:

- Every interactive surface is reachable via keyboard.
- Visible focus rings on focusable elements.
- ARIA labels on iconography.
- Sufficient contrast in both Light and Dark themes.

If you discover a regression, file an issue with the page path and the assistive technology used.
