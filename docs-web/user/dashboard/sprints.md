# Sprints

The **Sprints** page (`/sprints`) is where you plan, manage, and launch sprint runs.

## The sprint gallery and ledger

Sprints are viewed either in a visual organic cell gallery or a dense ledger format. Each sprint cell/row shows:

- **Status pill** — `idle`, `running`, `paused`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`.
- **Task counters** — completed / total, plus failures.
- **Goal** — first line of the sprint goal.
- **Action buttons** — Plan / Orchestrate / Pause / Cancel as appropriate.

Sprints can be **showcase-pinned** to surface them on the Overview page; toggle this from the cell menu or bulk actions.

### Provider Quota Waits

When an active sprint task is blocked because a configured provider has exhausted its rate limit or usage quota, the sprint bubble displays a **quota wait clock**. This clock shows a countdown to the reset time alongside the current wait status. During a quota wait, the sprint bubble continues to expose its normal task links and action menus so you can still inspect task progress or pause the sprint while waiting for the provider to recover.

## Creating a sprint

1. Click **+ New sprint**.
2. Enter:
   - **Name** (required)
   - **Goal** (recommended — used by the AI planner as context)
   - **Feature branch override** (optional — auto-derived from the prefix otherwise)
   - **Start / end dates** (optional — informational, used by Stats)
3. Save. The sprint appears on the board with status `idle`.

## AI sprint planning

Open a sprint and click **AI plan**. You provide:

- **Sprint prompt** — A description of what you want done. The planner accepts long, prose-style input.
- **Improvement option** *(optional)* — Click **Improve** to have the planner rewrite your prompt for clarity before planning.

Click **Plan sprint**. The planner agent (typically a Gemini, Codex or Claude session — see [Provider routing](../providers-and-models.md)) returns a tree of subtasks with:

- A title and prompt for each.
- Inferred `depends_on` edges.
- A best-effort `is_independent` flag.

You can:

- **Edit** each subtask inline.
- **Reorder / delete / add** subtasks.
- **Re-plan** with a different prompt.
- **Cancel** an in-flight planning request via the cancel button (this aborts the underlying provider session).

The plan is persisted as markdown files at `<repo>/.code-ux/sprints/sprint-<n>/<task-id>.md`. See [Sprint format](../../developer/sprint-format.md).

## The sprint DAG view

Sprints with multiple subtasks display a **DAG** (directed acyclic graph) of dependencies. This view is lazy-loaded and is the fastest way to validate that you have correct parallelism. Independent tasks float free; chained tasks render with explicit edges.

There is also an animated **Boat Race** visualisation that shows tasks as boats progressing along a track — fun and surprisingly informative when many tasks run in parallel.

## Running a sprint

Click **Orchestrate**. Code UX:

1. Creates a new **sprint run** record (a unique execution attempt).
2. Acquires a heartbeat lease so other instances cannot also pick up this run.
3. Hands control to the [watch loop](../sprint-orchestration.md#watch-loop) which begins cycling.
4. Switches the dashboard view to **Live Session**.

You can run any sprint multiple times. Each run has its own ID and its own row in stats and telemetry.

## Pausing & cancelling

- **Pause** — The sprint enters `paused`. The watch loop exits cleanly at the next checkpoint. Active worker sessions are *not* killed; you can resume later.
- **Cancel** — The sprint enters `cancel_requested` and is cancelled gracefully. Active dispatches are signalled to stop.
- **Force cancel** — Skips graceful steps. Use only if a normal cancel hangs.

Pausing / cancelling are also exposed as MCP actions via the `manage_sprints` tool (actions `pause`, `cancel`, `force_cancel`).

## Importing & exporting sprints

Sprints support importing issues directly from external providers, as well as being portable as Markdown bundles:

- **Issue Import** — Click **+ → Import** and choose **GitHub Issues**, **GitLab Issues**, or **Jira Issues**. You can search by text, labels, status, assignees, or exact issue keys (e.g., `#42` or `OPS-42`). Imported issues are attached as linked contexts, and Jira issues can optionally be converted directly into security or quality tasks. Code UX attempts to auto-transition or auto-close linked issues when the sprint completes.
- **Export** — Click **⋯ → Export markdown**. You receive a downloadable bundle: one file per subtask plus a `sprint.md` describing the sprint.
- **Import Bundle** — Click **+ → Import**. Drop a previously exported bundle (or a hand-written one). Code UX validates and creates the sprint.

Importing bundles is the recommended way to template sprints across projects when [Quicksprints](../quicksprints.md) are not flexible enough.

## Sprint settings overrides

Each sprint can override project settings, which in turn override system settings. Open the **⚙ Sprint settings** panel from the sprint detail view to edit. Common overrides:

- Different `featurePrAutoMergeMode` for risky sprints.
- Different provider model for `task_coding` (e.g. force GPT-5 Codex for performance-critical work).
- Different `automationLevel` (set to `ALWAYS_ASK` for sensitive sprints).

Effective settings are inspectable at `GET /api/projects/:projectId/sprints/:sprintId/settings/effective`.

## Sprint deletion and bulk actions

The Sprints ledger supports multi-select for bulk starting, pinning, or deleting sprints.

Deleting a sprint (single or bulk) requires explicit confirmation in a destructive dialog and removes its database state but leaves the on-disk markdown directory intact (so you can re-import later if you change your mind).
