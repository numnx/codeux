# Code UX Documentation

> **Code UX** is a local-first, container-first multi-provider runtime. It turns a goal into a
> managed sprint — planned, routed to the right agent, executed in isolated Docker workspaces,
> reviewed through Git and CI, and tracked in a live local dashboard — across hosted providers (like Jules)
> and local CLI/Docker providers (like Gemini, Codex, Claude Code, Qwen Code, OpenCode, and Antigravity).

This site is the public source mirror for installing, operating, integrating, and extending Code UX. Canonical docs live in `docs/`. Any generated MDX or routes here are derived artifacts. A `docs-release/` directory must not exist.

## At a glance

- **Multi-provider routing** — route work across seven providers per invocation type (planning, coding, QA, CI repair, merge-conflict), with weights, concurrency, and model defaults.
- **Container-first execution** — provider CLIs run in short-lived, isolated Docker workspaces by default; host execution is available when speed matters more than isolation.
- **Sprint orchestration** — dependency-aware DAG scheduling, parallel task dispatch, a continuous watch loop, and emergency-stop safety.
- **Git, CI & issue imports** — branch prep, PR/MR discovery, CI polling and merge gates, automated CI repair, and issue import from GitHub, GitLab, and Jira.
- **Scoped memory** — short-term sprint memory and long-term project memory keep prompts focused and token-efficient.
- **Live dashboard** — a real-time Preact UI at `http://localhost:4444` for projects, sprints, tasks, live sessions, agents, chat, memory, stats, and browser previews.
- **MCP server** — Code UX also speaks Model Context Protocol over stdio and authenticated Streamable HTTP, so MCP clients can drive the runtime directly.

## Conventions

- **Code paths** are repository-relative (e.g. `src/server/code-ux-server.ts`) so you can jump to the source.
- **Defaults** appear inline in tables, alongside the configuration key where applicable.
- **CLI examples** assume the `codeux` binary (or `npx @codeuxai/codeux`) is on your `PATH`.
