# Code UX Documentation

> **Code UX** is a multi-agent sprint orchestration platform that turns a single prompt into a fully managed engineering workflow — planning, dispatch, CI gating, merge, and review — across Jules, Gemini, Codex, Claude, Qwen, and OpenCode workers.

This documentation site is the canonical reference for installing, operating, integrating, and extending Code UX.

## At a glance

- **Sprint orchestration engine** — Markdown-defined sprints with a dependency-aware cycle runner, continuous watch loop, and emergency-stop safety.
- **Multi-provider workers** — Pluggable virtual workers run on Gemini, Codex, Claude Code, Qwen Code, OpenCode, or the hosted Jules API. Routing is controlled per task type, per project.
- **Live Preact dashboard** — Real-time WebSocket-backed UI on `http://localhost:4444` covering sprints, tasks, chat, agents, memory, sprint preview browsers, and stats.
- **MCP server** — Speaks Model Context Protocol over stdio and (optionally) Streamable HTTP. Exposes 7 tools, including the unified `manage_code_ux` action surface (8 management domains, 60+ actions).
- **Built-in CI gate** — Live PR monitoring, configurable auto-merge policies, optional CI autofix retries, merge-conflict escalation.
- **Memory & embeddings** — On-device embedding models (ONNX runtime), short-term sprint memory, long-term project memory with promotion and semantic search.
- **Sprint preview browser** — Spin up Docker preview containers per sprint with a live in-app browser, port mapping, and editable startup scripts.

## Conventions used in this documentation

- **Code paths** are given as repository-relative paths (e.g. `src/server/jules-agent-server.ts`) so you can jump straight to the source.
- **Defaults** appear inline in tables. Where a value is configurable, the configuration key is listed alongside it.
- **CLI examples** assume the `jules-subagents` binary or `npx jules-subagents` is on `PATH`.
- **Endpoints** use `:paramName` for path parameters and document required query parameters separately.

## Versioning

This documentation tracks the `1.2.x` release line of the `jules-subagents` npm package, which is published from the `main` branch. The runtime announces its MCP server identity as `code-ux` (the active product name).
