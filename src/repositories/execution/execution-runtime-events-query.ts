// `status_sync` events are internal bookkeeping written by ProjectRuntimeRepository on every
// status-signature change (they only carry `{ previousSignature, signature }` diagnostic strings).
// Nothing in the dashboard or the human-intervention summary reads them, yet because they are
// emitted so frequently they dominated the live snapshot payload (hundreds of KB → >1MB pushes
// that froze the browser tab). Exclude them from the live runtime-event feed entirely.
//
// The expanded-sprint-run feed is also capped: a single long or chatty sprint run can accumulate
// thousands of task-run events, and pulling them all balloons the realtime snapshot to several MB,
// which the renderer re-parses on every tick and freezes the app. The live feed only needs recent
// activity (full history is available on demand elsewhere), so each active run contributes at most
// `EXPANDED_EVENTS_PER_RUN_LIMIT` recent events (applied PER run via a window function so a chatty
// run can never evict a quieter parallel run's events) and the merged feed is capped at
// `MAX_RUNTIME_EVENTS`. The per-run cap matches the final cap so a single active run keeps its full
// recent history up to the payload bound rather than losing its oldest events.
